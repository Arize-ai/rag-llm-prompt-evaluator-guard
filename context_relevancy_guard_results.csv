968,Q2246,what is lean manufacturing and who developed,Lean manufacturing,"Lean manufacturing, lean enterprise, or lean production, often simply, ""Lean,"" is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, ""value"" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Essentially, lean is centered on preserving value with less work. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as ""Lean"" only in the 1990s. TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of Toyota , from a small company to the world's largest automaker, has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.","LEAN MANUFACTURING, LEAN ENTERPRISE, OR LEAN PRODUCTION, OFTEN SIMPLY, ""LEAN,"" IS A PRODUCTION PRACTICE THAT CONSIDERS THE EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES FOR ANY GOAL OTHER THAN THE CREATION OF VALUE FOR THE END CUSTOMER TO BE WASTEFUL, AND THUS A TARGET FOR ELIMINATION.

1224,Q2572,what is rationalism by john locke george berkeley,George Berkeley,"George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers , and as a result cannot exist without being perceived. Thus, as Berkeley famously put it, for physical objects ""esse est percipi"" ("" to be is to be perceived ""). Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction , an important premise in his argument for immaterialism. In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, , in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour. This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge in 1710 which, after its poor reception, he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous in 1713. In this book, Berkeley's views were represented by Philonous (Greek: 'lover of mind'), while Hylas (Greek: 'matter') embodies the Irish thinker’s opponents, in particular John Locke . Berkeley argued against Sir Isaac Newton 's doctrine of absolute space , time and motion in De Motu (on Motion), published 1721. His arguments were a precursor to the views of Mach and Einstein . In 1732, he published Alciphron , a Christian apologetic against the free-thinkers , and in 1734, he published The Analyst , an empiricist critique of the foundations of infinitesimal calculus , which was influential in the development of mathematics. His last major philosophical work, Siris (1744), begins by advocating the medicinal use of tar water , and then continues to discuss a wide range of topics including science, philosophy, and theology. Interest in Berkeley's work increased after World War II, because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.","George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others).

1721,Q488,how many died in hiroshima and nagasaki,Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were conducted by the United States during the final stages of World War II in 1945. The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. Following a firebombing campaign that destroyed many Japanese cities, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of Japan . The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on 8 May, but the Pacific War continued. Together with the United Kingdom and the Republic of China , the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, threatening Japan with ""prompt and utter destruction"". The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum, and the United States deployed two nuclear weapons developed by the Manhattan Project . American airmen dropped Little Boy on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, followed by Fat Man over Nagasaki on 9 August. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day. The Hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that, of the people who died on the day of the explosion, 60% died from flash or flame burns, 30% from falling debris and 10% from other causes. During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness , and other injuries, compounded by illness. In a US estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death, 15–20% died from radiation sickness, 20–30% from burns, and 50–60% from other injuries, compounded by illness. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison. On 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies, signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September, officially ending World War II. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan 's adopting Three Non-Nuclear Principles , forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.

252,Q1321,what state was the civil war in,American Civil War,"The American Civil War (ACW), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War (see naming ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States (the ""Union"" or the ""North"") and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""Confederacy"" or the ""South""). The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. Foreign powers did not intervene. After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began. In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States' territories . Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on "" King Cotton "" that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America. Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Robert E. Lee's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg . Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864. In the Western Theater, William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way. The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital. The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars . Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I . It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.

The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system . Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia . Hyperthermia can also be deliberately induced using drugs or medical devices and may be used in the treatment of some kinds of cancer and other conditions, most commonly in conjunction with radiotherapy . Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains unchanged.

As granted by the Constitution ( Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 ), Presidents have the power to grant clemency in one or more of the following ways: the ability to grant a full pardon , to commute a sentence, or to rescind a fine. U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law. As to the difference between a pardon and a commutation: A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction. A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself. Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone. The records of acts of clemency were public until 1934. In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President H. W. Bush forward are now listed.

U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law. As to the difference between a pardon and a commutation: A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction. A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself. Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone. The records of acts of clemency were public until 1934. In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President H. W. Bush forward are now listed.

841,Q2084,what was john adams doing to help france,John Adams,"John Adams (October 30, 1735 ( O.S. October 19, 1735) – July 4, 1826) was the second president of the United States (1797–1801), having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States . An American Founding Father , he was a statesman, diplomat, and a leading advocate of American independence from Great Britain . Well educated, he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas, both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers . Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution . A lawyer and public figure in Boston , as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , he played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence. He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and was its primary advocate in the Congress. Later, as a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers. A political theorist and historian, Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government , influenced American political thought. One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character: in 1775, he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States . Adams' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president. During his one term, he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian Republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton . Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war (called the "" Quasi-War "") with France , 1798–1800. The major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton's opposition. In 1800, Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts. He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson. He and his wife, Abigail Adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family . Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams , the sixth President of the United States. His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders.

670,Q1855,what states has the electric chair,Electric chair,"Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. This execution method was created by employees of Thomas Edison during the War of Currents , and has been used only in the United States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines (its first use there in 1924 under American occupation , last in 1976). Historically, once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles (differing in voltage and duration) of alternating current would be passed through the individual's body, in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs (including the brain). The first jolt of electric current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs. Death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart . Although in the United States the electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution. Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution, today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner. As of 2010, electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method. In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 (Kentucky: March 31, 1998; Tennessee: December 31, 1998) and who chose electrocution. In both states, inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are killed by lethal injection . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution. It is the sole method of execution in Vermont, where treason is the only capital crime. On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a ""cruel and unusual punishment"" under the state's constitution. This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska, the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution for murder.","Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body.

It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its primary , having 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, resulting in its mass . The Moon is the second densest satellite after Io , a satellite of Jupiter. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun , although its surface is actually very dark, with a reflectance similar to that of coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language , calendars , art and mythology . The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance, about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses .

The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago, not long after the Earth. Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars -sized body. The Moon is the only celestial body other than Earth on which humans have set foot . The Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959; the United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being Apollo 11 . These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon's origins, the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history .

The world's oldest known winery (dated to 3000 BCE) was discovered in Areni-1 cave in a mountainous area of Armenia . URL_http . Increasingly clear archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of the grapevine took place during the Early Bronze Age in the Near East , Sumer and Egypt from around the third millennium BCE. Evidence of the earliest wine production in Balkans has been uncovered at archaeological sites in northern Greece ( Macedonia ), dated to 4500 BC. These same sites also contain remnants of the world's earliest evidence of crushed grapes. In Egypt , wine became a part of recorded history, playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life . Traces of wild wine dating from the second and first millennia BCE have also been found in China. Moroccan wine Kasher label 1930 The Jewish tradition and use of kosher wine is dating back to biblical times . The long history of the use and production of wine throughout ancient Israel is backed up by archeological evidence. Within the Jewish diaspora communities all around the globe, the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day. Wine, linked in myth to Dionysus / Bacchus , was common in ancient Greece and Rome , and many of today's major wine-producing regions of Western Europe were established with Phoenician and, later, Roman plantations. Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known; the design of the wine press advanced; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine. Rashi , a medieval French rabbi and called the ""father"" of all commentaries that followed on the Talmud and the Tanakh, earned his living as a vintner . Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export, the Christian Church in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of wine, necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass. Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures, its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated. Geber and other Muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume . Wine production gradually increased, with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards. Wine production survived the devastating Phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world.","Wine boy at a Greek symposium The history of wine spans thousands of years and is closely intertwined with the history of agriculture , cuisine , civilization and humanity itself.

Increasingly clear archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of the grapevine took place during the Early Bronze Age in the Near East , Sumer and Egypt from around the third millennium BCE. Evidence of the earliest wine production in Balkans has been uncovered at archaeological sites in northern Greece ( Macedonia ), dated to 4500 BC. These same sites also contain remnants of the world's earliest evidence of crushed grapes. In Egypt , wine became a part of recorded history, playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life . Traces of wild wine dating from the second and first millennia BCE have also been found in China. Moroccan wine Kasher label 1930 The Jewish tradition and use of kosher wine is dating back to biblical times . The long history of the use and production of wine throughout ancient Israel is backed up by archeological evidence. Within the Jewish diaspora communities all around the globe, the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day. Wine, linked in myth to Dionysus / Bacchus , was common in ancient Greece and Rome , and many of today's major wine-producing regions of Western Europe were established with Phoenician and, later, Roman plantations. Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known; the design of the wine press advanced; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine. Rashi , a medieval French rabbi and called the ""father"" of all commentaries that followed on the Talmud and the Tanakh, earned his living as a vintner . Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export, the Christian Church in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of wine, necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass. Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures, its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated. Geber and other Muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume . Wine production gradually increased, with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards. Wine production survived the devastating Phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world.",True,True,1.6949901250191033,True,1.2288605409557931
1442,Q2862,what is bracketing in photography,Bracketing,"In photography , bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings. Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot, especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image. Autobracketing is automatic bracketing by using a setting on the camera to take several bracketed shots (in contrast to the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot). Given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots, it is typically, but not always, used for static subjects.","IN PHOTOGRAPHY , BRACKETING IS THE GENERAL TECHNIQUE OF TAKING SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SAME SUBJECT USING DIFFERENT CAMERA SETTINGS.

210,Q1271,what months are in each season,Season,"A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight . Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant. During May, June and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux . However, due to seasonal lag , June, July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere. In temperate and subpolar regions, generally four calendar -based seasons (with their adjectives) are recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal) and winter (hibernal). However, ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

972,Q2250,what is vitamin a for,Vitamin A,"Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons, which include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important. Vitamin A has multiple functions, it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal , which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the light-absorbing molecule , that is necessary for both low-light ( scotopic vision) and color vision . Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid , which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells. In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester , primarily retinyl palmitate , which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol ) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal . The associated acid (retinoic acid), a metabolite that can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin A, has only partial vitamin A activity, and does not function in the retina for the visual cycle. Retinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiation. All forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached, called a retinyl group. Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity. The orange pigment of carrots – beta-carotene – can be represented as two connected retinyl groups, which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levels. Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group, which give them some vitamin activity. None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity. The carotenoid beta- cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods : Retinol , the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate . The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin (all of which contain beta-ionone rings), but no other carotenoids , function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme (15-15'-dioxygenase) which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it retinol. In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal (resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species).","Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons, which include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important.

Another example might be testing plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the plants in a garden: the plants that receive no fertilizer are the control group, because they establish the baseline level of growth that the fertilizer-treated plants will be compared against. Without a control group, the experiment cannot determine whether the fertilizer-treated plants grow more than they would have if untreated. Ideally, all variables in an experiment will be controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none will be uncontrolled. In such an experiment, if all the controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment is working as intended and that the results of the experiment are due to the effect of the variable being tested.

1649,Q395,what do ancients myths explain,Greek Mythology,"Bust of Zeus , Otricoli (Sala Rotonda, Museo Pio-Clementino , Vatican ). Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece and is part of religion in modern Greece and around the world , known as Hellenismos . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world, and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines , and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature . The oldest known Greek literary sources, Homer's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on events surrounding the Trojan War . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians of the fifth century BC, in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology, with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts. Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence. Greek mythology has had an extensive influence on the culture, arts, and literature of Western civilization and remains part of Western heritage and language.

Roosevelt signs the Lend-Lease bill to give aid to Britain and China (1941) The Lend Lease act was an act where the United States had supported its allies. Lend-Lease () was the law that started a program under which the United States of America supplied the United Kingdom , the USSR , Republic of China , Free France , and other Allied nations with materiel between 1941 and 1945. It was signed into law on March 11, 1941, a year and a half after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939. This was nine months before the U.S. entered the war in December 1941. Formally titled An Act to Further Promote the Defense of the United States, the Act effectively ended the United States' pretense of neutrality . A total of $50 .1 billion (equivalent to $ today) worth of supplies were shipped: $31.4 billion to Britain, $11.3 billion to the Soviet Union, $3.2 billion to France, $1.6 billion to China, and smaller sums to other Allies. Reverse Lend-Lease comprised services such as rent on air bases that went to the U.S., and totaled $7.8 billion; of this, $6.8 billion came from the British and the Commonwealth . The terms of the agreement provided that the materiel was to be used until time for their return or destruction. Supplies after the termination date were sold to Britain at a large discount for £1 .075 billion using long-term loans from the United States. Canada operated a similar program that sent $4.7 billion in supplies to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The United States did not charge for aid supplied under this legislation.

769,Q1998,when did the titanic sink,RMS Titanic,"RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton , UK to New York City , US. The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage. She was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line , and she was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast with Thomas Andrews , who perished with the ship, as her naval architect. On her maiden voyage, she carried 2,224 passengers and crew. Under the command of Edward Smith , her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland , Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America. The ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use. Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, she lacked enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard. Because of outdated maritime safety regulations, she carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number travelling on the maiden voyage, and one-third her total passenger and crew capacity. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship's time. The glancing collision caused Titanics hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "" women and children first "" protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats. By 2:20 AM, she broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after the Titanic foundered, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors. The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety . One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications---which could have saved many more passengers. Many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute; many families, particularly those of crew members from Southampton, lost their primary bread-winners. They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations. Some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board; the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay , faced social ostracism for the rest of his life. The wreck of the Titanic remains on the seabed, split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of .

The inside of a cube , a cylinder or a sphere is three-dimensional because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces. In physical terms, dimension refers to the constituent structure of all space ( volume ) and its position in time (perceived as a scalar dimension along the t-axis), as well as the spatial constitution of objects within—structures that correlate with both particle and field conceptions, interact according to relative properties of mass —and are fundamentally mathematical in description.

1752,Q53,how bad burns go to burn center,Burn,"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation . Most burns affect only the superficial skin (known as superficial or first degree) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin (known as partial thickness or second degree). Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness (third degree) or fourth degree. The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns maybe managed with little more than simple pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers .

Most burns affect only the superficial skin (known as superficial or first degree) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin (known as partial thickness or second degree). Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness (third degree) or fourth degree.

1420,Q283,how many canals in mandibular first molar,Mandibular first molar,"The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face ) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second molars . It is located on the mandibular (lower) arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary (upper) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion. The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication , commonly known as chewing. There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek), two lingual (side nearest the tongue ), and one distal. There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar. The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it. Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars. In the universal system of notation , the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""S"", and the left one is known as ""L"". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""84"", and the left one is known as ""74"". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular first molars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""30"", and the left one is known as ""19"". The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right first molars would have the same number, ""6"", but the right one would have the symbol, ""┐"", over it, while the left one would have, ""┌"". The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""46"", and the left one is known as ""36"". Mandibular primary first molars usually have four pulp horns. The first molar is usually the first permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones. Anatomy: The mandibular first molar has five cusps: the mesiobuccal (MB, toward midline and cheek), mesiolingual (ML, toward midline and tongue), distolingual (DL, away from midline and towards tongue), distobuccal (DB, away from midline and toward cheek), and distal (D, away from midline), listed in order of decreasing size. Listed in order of decreasing height they are: ML, DL, DF, MF, and D. An eighth cusp was found in a primary second lower molar in an Argentinean child. Viewed from the top of the tooth (occlusal view), the mandibular first molar is pentagonal (five sided) in shape and tapers toward the lingual, with the sides being the buccal surface, the mesial surface, the lingual surface, distal surface, and the distobuccal surface. The occlusal surface has four grooves. The central groove is not straight but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits (mesial, central, central, and distal). The distobuccal groove runs from the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps. The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps. The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit. The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves (buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel). From the buccal (buccal view), two roots are present. The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature. The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown.","The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face ) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second molars .

1081,Q239,what does metes and bounds mean,Metes and bounds,"Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land, real property (in contrast to personal property) or real estate . The system has been used in England for many centuries, and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries. By custom, it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States , and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law .

The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a point of beginning , returning back to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds . It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys. At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments. The term ""metes"" refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction.

1805,Q598,what countries legalize marijuana,Legality of cannabis,"The legality of cannabis varies from country to country. Possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s. However, many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis, particularly in North America , South America and Europe . Furthermore, possession is legal or effectively legal in the Netherlands , North Korea and would be in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington if it were not for federal law, which governs persons in all states. The medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries, including Canada , the Czech Republic and Israel . While federal law in the United States bans all sale and possession of cannabis, enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law; two states ( Colorado and Washington ) have repealed their laws prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis and replaced them with a regulatory regime, also contrary to federal statute. Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but, apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana, most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe. Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation, use, possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use. A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis, making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment . Some jurisdictions/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users, with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes. There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in Canada . Drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs. However, simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries, particularly in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution.","The legality of cannabis varies from country to country.

1981,Q816,what does the royal family do,British Royal Family,"The British Royal Family is the group of close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom . The term is also commonly applied to the same group of people who are the relations of the monarch in her or his role as sovereign of any of the other Commonwealth realms , thus sometimes at variance with official national terms for the family. Members of the Royal Family belong to, either by birth or marriage, the House of Windsor , since 1917, when George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha . This decision was primarily taken because Britain and her Empire were at war with Germany and given the British Royal Family's strong German ancestry; it was felt that its public image could be improved by choosing a more British house name. The new name chosen, Windsor, had absolutely no connection other than as the name of the castle which was and continues to be a royal residence. Although in the United Kingdom there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family, and different lists will include different people, those carrying the style Her or His Majesty (HM) , or Her or His Royal Highness (HRH) are always considered members, which usually results in the application of the term to the monarch, the consort of the monarch, the widowed consorts of previous monarchs, the children of the monarch and previous monarchs, the male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, and the spouses and the widows of a monarch's and previous monarch's sons and male-line grandsons. On 30 November 1917, King George V issued Letters Patent defining who are members of the Royal Family; the text of the notice from the London Gazette is as follows: In 1996, Her Majesty The Queen modified these Letters Patent, as was evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette: In 2013 Letters Patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the Royal Family to additional persons to be born, evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette: Members and relatives of the British Royal Family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the British Empire , sometimes for extended periods as viceroys , or for specific ceremonies or events. Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Aside from the monarch, their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve, if eligible and when appointed by letters patent, as a Counsellor of State , two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown (within stipulated limits) in the indisposal or absence from the British realm of the monarch. In the other realms of the Commonwealth royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State. However in each such realm the monarch's family members may act on behalf of, are funded by, and represent the sovereign of that particular state, and not the United Kingdom. The Queen, her consort, her children and grandchildren, as well as all former sovereigns' children and grandchildren hold places in the first sections of the official orders of precedence in England and Wales , Scotland , and Northern Ireland . Wives of the said enjoy their husbands' precedence, and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well. However, the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the Royal Family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra, who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall, who is otherwise the realm's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself.

Alexander Joseph ""Lex"" Luthor is a fictional character , a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics . Luthor is the archenemy of Superman , and as a high-status supervillain, has also come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe . Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster , the character first appeared in Action Comics #23 (April 1940 ). Luthor is described as ""a power-mad, evil scientist"" of high intelligence and incredible technological prowess. Luthor's goals typically center on killing Superman, the foremost obstacle to achieving the villain's megalomaniacal goals. Despite periodically wearing a powered exoskeleton , Luthor has traditionally lacked superpowers or a dual identity . The character was originally depicted as a mad scientist who, in the vein of pulp novels , wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry. In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown with a full head of red hair . Despite this, the character later became hairless as the result of an artist's mistake. A 1960 story by Jerry Siegel expanded upon Luthor's origin and motivations, revealing him to be a childhood friend of Superman 's who lost his hair when a fire destroyed his laboratory; Luthor vowed revenge. Following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths , the character was re-imagined as a Machiavellian industrialist and white-collar criminal, even briefly serving as President of the United States . In recent years, various writers have revived Luthor's mad scientist persona from the 1940s. The character was ranked as the 8th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its 100 Greatest Villains of All Time list. IGN 's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Luthor as #4.

494,Q1626,what president was theodore roosevelt,Theodore Roosevelt,"Theodore ""T.R."" Roosevelt, Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858—January 6, 1919) was the 26th President of the United States (1901–1909). He is noted for his exuberant personality, range of interests and achievements, and his leadership of the Progressive Movement , as well as his "" cowboy "" persona and robust masculinity . He was a leader of the Republican Party and founder of the first incarnation of the short-lived Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party of 1912 . Before becoming President, he held offices at the city, state, and federal levels. Roosevelt's achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as a politician. Roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as President of the United States in 1901, making him the youngest president ever; he beat out the youngest elected president, John F. Kennedy , by only one year. Roosevelt was also the first of only three sitting presidents to have won the Nobel Peace Prize . The Teddy bear is named after him, despite his contempt for being called ""Teddy"". Born into a wealthy family in New York City, Roosevelt was a sickly child who suffered from asthma and stayed at home studying natural history . To overcome his physical weakness, he embraced a strenuous life. Home-schooled, he became an eager student of nature. He attended Harvard University , where he studied biology, boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs. In 1881, one year out of Harvard, he was elected to the New York State Assembly , where he became a leader of the reform faction of his Republican Party (the ""GOP""). His The Naval War of 1812 (1882) established his professional reputation as a serious historian; he wrote numerous books on hunting, the outdoors, and current political issues, as well as frontier history. In 1884, his first wife and his mother died on the same day. He temporarily left politics and went to the frontier, becoming a rancher in the ""Badlands"" in the Dakotas. Returning to New York City, he ran for mayor in 1886, finishing third with 60,000 votes. He later gained fame by taking vigorous charge of the city police. At the national level, he was a leader in civil service reform. The Spanish–American War broke out in 1898 while Roosevelt was, effectively, running the Department of the Navy . He promptly resigned and formed the Rough Riders – a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in Cuba . The war hero was elected governor in 1898 and in 1900 was nominated for vice president. He successfully energized the GOP base as a highly visible campaigner to reelect President William McKinley on a platform of high tariffs, the gold standard, imperialism, prosperity at home and victory abroad. In 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became President. He attempted to move the Republican Party (GOP) toward Progressivism , including trust busting and increased regulation of businesses. Roosevelt became the first person elected to a term in his own right in 1904 after having ascended to the Presidency (from the Vice-Presidency) upon the death of his predecessor, winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since the uncontested election of 1820 . Roosevelt coined the phrase "" Square Deal "" to describe his domestic agenda, emphasizing that the average citizen would get a fair share under his policies. As an outdoorsman and naturalist, he promoted the conservation movement .

1099,Q2409,what is leasehold; real estate,Leasehold estate,"A leasehold estate is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant holds rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord . Although a tenant does hold rights to real property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property. Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time. As lease is a legal estate, leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market. A leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time, and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let (rented) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly. Until the end of the lease period (often measured in decades or centuries; a 99 year lease is quite common) the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner. Terms of the agreement are contained in a lease , which has elements of contract and property law intertwined. The term estate for years may occasionally be used. This refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time (the word ""years"" is misleading). An estate for years is not automatically renewed. Colloquially, ""lease"" and "" leasing "" are often a formalization of a longer, specific period as compared with a ""rental"" that created a tenancy at will , terminable or renewable at the end of a short period.","A LEASEHOLD ESTATE IS AN OWNERSHIP OF A TEMPORARY RIGHT TO HOLD LAND OR PROPERTY IN WHICH A LESSEE OR A TENANT HOLDS RIGHTS OF REAL PROPERTY BY SOME FORM OF TITLE FROM A LESSOR OR LANDLORD .

Political violence has occurred regularly throughout its history , leading to government instability. Most recently, in February 2004, a coup d'état originating in the north of the country forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . A provisional government took control with security provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Michel Martelly , the current president, was elected in the Haitian general election, 2011 . The island has had a history of destructive earthquakes. A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on 12 January 2010 and devastated Port-au-Prince. The highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000. Haitian government estimates were higher. The Presidential palace, Parliament and many other important structures were destroyed, along with countless homes and businesses, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless. The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake (and subsequent incidents) due to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010, as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake.

Political violence has occurred regularly throughout its history , leading to government instability. Most recently, in February 2004, a coup d'état originating in the north of the country forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . A provisional government took control with security provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Michel Martelly , the current president, was elected in the Haitian general election, 2011 . The island has had a history of destructive earthquakes. A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on 12 January 2010 and devastated Port-au-Prince. The highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000. Haitian government estimates were higher. The Presidential palace, Parliament and many other important structures were destroyed, along with countless homes and businesses, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless. The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake (and subsequent incidents) due to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010, as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake. United States aid organizations have donated $2 billion. Combined with other international donations, these funds are intended to contribute to the rebuilding of the country.",False,True,2.754915333003737,True,1.1814090000116266

347,Q1438,"what is ""thin film"" technology",Thin film,"A thin film is a layer of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer ( monolayer ) to several micrometers in thickness. Electronic semiconductor devices and optical coatings are the main applications benefiting from thin-film construction. A familiar application of thin films is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors. A very-thin-film coating (less than a nanometer thick) is used to produce two-way mirrors . The performance of optical coatings (e.g. antireflective , or AR, coatings) are typically enhanced when the thin-film coating consists of multiple layers having varying thicknesses and refractive indices . Similarly, a periodic structure of alternating thin films of different materials may collectively form a so-called superlattice which exploits the phenomenon of quantum confinement by restricting electronic phenomena to two-dimensions. Work is being done with ferromagnetic and ferroelectric thin films for use as computer memory . It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via thin-film drug delivery . Thin-films are used to produce thin-film batteries . Thin films are also used in dye-sensitized solar cells . Ceramic thin films are in wide use. The relatively high hardness and inertness of ceramic materials make this type of thin coating of interest for protection of substrate materials against corrosion, oxidation and wear. In particular, the use of such coatings on cutting tools can extend the life of these items by several orders of magnitude. Research is being done on a new class of thin-film inorganic oxide materials, called amorphous heavy-metal cation multicomponent oxides, which could be used to make transparent transistors that are inexpensive, stable, and environmentally benign.","A THIN FILM IS A LAYER OF MATERIAL RANGING FROM FRACTIONS OF A NANOMETER ( MONOLAYER ) TO SEVERAL MICROMETERS IN THICKNESS.

Our Gang (also known as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach's Rascals) are a series of American comedy short films about a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures. Created by comedy producer Hal Roach , the series is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way, as Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected, raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles. In addition, Our Gang notably put boys, girls, whites and blacks together in a group as equals, something that ""broke new ground,"" according to film historian Leonard Maltin . Such a thing had never been done before in cinema but has since been repeated after the success of Our Gang. The first production at the Roach studio in 1922 was a series of silent short subjects. When Roach changed distributors from Pathé to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1927, and converted the series to sound in 1929, the series took off even further. Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938, when the series was sold to MGM, who then continued producing the comedies until 1944. The Our Gang series includes a total of 220 shorts and one feature film, General Spanky , featuring over forty-one child actors . As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights, the 80 Roach-produced ""talkies"" were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955.

1708,Q474,how much water is the human body made of,Body water,"In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body . A significant fraction of the human body is water. Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that ""the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight. In a newborn infant, this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight, but it progressively decreases from birth to old age, most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life. Also, obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body, sometimes to as low as 45 percent"". These figures are statistical averages, so are illustrative, and like all biostatistics, will vary with things like type of population, age and number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure. For example, Jackson's (1985) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60% for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water, which approximates Guyton's 57%. In diseased states where body water is affected, the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem. Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide . Per Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology, body water is broken down into the following compartments: Intracellular fluid (2/3 of body water). Per Guyton, in a body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5% (5/8), close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb. Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular. Extracellular fluid (1/3 of body water). Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5% Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here. Plasma (1/5 of extracellular fluid).

1433,Q2851,where is thomas more buried,Thomas More,"Sir Thomas More (; 7 February 14786 July 1535), known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas More since 1935, was an English lawyer, social philosopher , author, statesman , and noted Renaissance humanist . He was an important councillor to Henry VIII of England and was Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532. He was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century. In 2000, Pope John Paul II declared him patron of Catholic statesmen and politicians. More was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation , in particular of Martin Luther and William Tyndale . However, since 1980, he is also commemorated by the Church of England as a reformation martyr. More coined the word "" utopia "" – a name he gave to the ideal and imaginary island nation, the political system of which he described in Utopia , published in 1516. He opposed the King's separation from the Roman Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England , a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534 . He was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath required by the First Succession Act , because the act disparaged Papal Authority and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon . In 1535, he was tried for treason , convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded. More also helped to originate the phrase ""grasp at straws"" to mean ""desperately trying even useless things"", in his Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation. Intellectuals and statesmen across Europe were stunned by More's execution. Erasmus saluted him as one ""whose soul was more pure than any snow, whose genius was such that England never had and never again will have its like"". There was a more controversial side to More's life, because he advocated the persecution and execution of Protestants who refused to recant their faith. However, the judgement of history has been largely willing to forgive this in light of the times he lived in and his martyrdom in the Roman Catholic cause. Two centuries later Jonathan Swift said More was ""the person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced"", a sentiment with which Samuel Johnson agreed.

Although South Africa was instrumental in the creation of the Rugby World Cup competition, the Springboks did not compete in the first two World Cups in 1987 and 1991 because of anti-apartheid sporting boycotts of South Africa. The team made its World Cup debut in 1995 , when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament. The Springboks then defeated the All Blacks 15–12 in the final , which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa's sporting history, and a watershed moment in the post-Apartheid nation-building process.

2085,Q96,how can hoa collect unpaid fees on property,Homeowner association,"For a discussion of nonprofit, voluntary neighborhood advocacy groups, see neighborhood association . In the United States, a homeowner association is a corporation formed by a real estate developer for the purpose of marketing, managing, and selling of homes and lots in a residential subdivision. It grants the developer privileged voting rights in governing the association, while allowing the developer to exit financial and legal responsibility of the organization, typically by transferring ownership of the association to the homeowners after selling off a predetermined number of lots. Membership in the homeowners association by a residential buyer is typically a condition of purchase; a buyer isn't given an option to reject it. Most homeowner associations are incorporated, and are subject to state statutes that govern non-profit corporations and homeowner associations. State oversight of homeowner associations is minimal, and mainly takes the form of laws which are inconsistent from state to state. Some states, such as Florida and California, have a large body of homeowner association law, and some states, such as Massachusetts, have virtually no homeowner association law. The fastest growing form of housing in the United States today is common-interest developments (CIDs), a category that includes planned-unit developments of single-family homes , condominiums , and cooperative apartments .

1971,Q804,what do jehovah witnesses believe,Jehovah's Witnesses,"Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity .Sources for descriptors:• Millenarian: • Restorationist: • Christian: • Denomination: The organization reports worldwide membership of over 7.78 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance of over 12 million, and annual Memorial attendance of over 19 million. They are directed by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses , a group of elders in Brooklyn, New York , that establishes all doctrines. Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs are based on their interpretations of the Bible and they prefer to use their own translation, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures . They believe that the destruction of the present world system at Armageddon is imminent, and that the establishment of God's kingdom on earth is the only solution for all problems faced by mankind. The group emerged from the Bible Student movement —founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell with the formation of Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society —with significant organizational and doctrinal changes under the leadership of Joseph Franklin Rutherford . The name Jehovah's witnesses, based on Isaiah 43:10–12, was adopted in 1931 to distinguish themselves from other Bible Student groups and symbolize a break with the legacy of Russell's traditions. Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching, distributing literature such as The Watchtower and Awake! , and refusing military service and blood transfusions . They consider use of the name Jehovah vital for proper worship. They reject Trinitarianism , inherent immortality of the soul , and hellfire , which they consider to be unscriptural doctrines. They do not observe Christmas , Easter , birthdays , or other holidays and customs they consider to have pagan origins incompatible with Christianity. Adherents commonly refer to their body of beliefs as ""the truth"" and consider themselves to be ""in the truth"". They consider secular society to be morally corrupt and under the influence of Satan , and most limit their social interaction with non-Witnesses. Congregational disciplinary actions include disfellowshipping , their term for formal expulsion and shunning . Baptized individuals who formally leave are considered disassociated and are also shunned. Disfellowshipped and disassociated individuals may eventually be reinstated if deemed repentant. The religion's position regarding conscientious objection to military service and refusal to salute national flags has brought it into conflict with some governments. Consequently, Jehovah's Witnesses have been persecuted and their activities are banned or restricted in some countries. Persistent legal challenges by Jehovah's Witnesses have influenced legislation related to civil rights in several countries.","Jehovah's Witnesses is a millenarian restorationist Christian denomination with nontrinitarian beliefs distinct from mainstream Christianity .Sources for descriptors:• Millenarian: • Restorationist: • Christian: • Denomination: The organization reports worldwide membership of over 7.78 million adherents involved in evangelism , convention attendance of over 12 million, and annual Memorial attendance of over 19 million.

Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists so they could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks . Two of those planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City.

2083,Q958,what happened on april 11 1861 at fort sumter,Battle of Fort Sumter,"The Battle of Fort Sumter (April 12–14, 1861) was the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter , near Charleston, South Carolina , that started the American Civil War . Following declarations of secession by seven Southern states , South Carolina demanded that the U.S. Army abandon its facilities in Charleston Harbor. On December 26, 1860, U.S. Major Robert Anderson surreptitiously moved his small command from the indefensible Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island to Fort Sumter, a substantial fortress controlling the entrance of Charleston Harbor. An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson, using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West , failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area, except for Fort Sumter. During the early months of 1861, the situation around Fort Sumter increasingly began to resemble a siege. In March, Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard , the first general officer of the newly formed Confederate States of America , was placed in command of Confederate forces in Charleston. Beauregard energetically directed the strengthening of batteries around Charleston harbor aimed at Fort Sumter. Conditions in the fort grew dire as the Union soldiers rushed to complete the installation of additional guns. Anderson was short of men, food, and supplies. The resupply of Fort Sumter became the first crisis of the administration of President Abraham Lincoln . He notified the Governor of South Carolina, Francis W. Pickens , that he was sending supply ships, which resulted in an ultimatum from the Confederate government: evacuate Fort Sumter immediately. Major Anderson refused to surrender. Beginning at 4:30 a.m. on April 12, the Confederates bombarded the fort from artillery batteries surrounding the harbor. Although the Union garrison returned fire, they were significantly outgunned and, after 34 hours, Major Anderson agreed to evacuate. There was no loss of life on either side as a direct result of this engagement, although a gun explosion during the surrender ceremonies on April 14 caused two Union deaths. Following the battle, there was widespread support from both North and South for further military action. Lincoln's immediate call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion resulted in an additional four southern slave states also declaring their secession and joining the Confederacy. The Civil War had begun.","The Battle of Fort Sumter (April 12–14, 1861) was the bombardment and surrender of Fort Sumter , near Charleston, South Carolina , that started the American Civil War .

1264,Q2627,when was the Declaration of Independence Signing,United States Declaration of Independence,"The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies , then at war with Great Britain , regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire . Instead they now formed a new nation—the United States of America. John Adams was a leader in pushing for independence, which was unanimously approved on July 2. A committee had already drafted the formal declaration, to be ready when congress voted on independence. Adams persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, which congress would edit to produce the final version. The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War . The national birthday, the Independence Day is celebrated on July 4, although Adams wanted July 2. After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. The most famous version of the Declaration, a signed copy that is popularly regarded as the Declaration of Independence, is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C. Although the wording of the Declaration was approved on July 4, the date of its signing was August 2. The original July 4 United States Declaration of Independence manuscript was lost while all other copies have been derived from this original document. The sources and interpretation of the Declaration have been the subject of much scholarly inquiry. The Declaration justified the independence of the United States by listing colonial grievances against King George III , and by asserting certain natural and legal rights , including a right of revolution . Having served its original purpose in announcing independence, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored after the American Revolution . Since then, it has come to be considered a major statement on human rights , particularly its second sentence: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . This has been called ""one of the best-known sentences in the English language"", containing ""the most potent and consequential words in American history."" The passage came to represent a moral standard to which the United States should strive. This view was notably promoted by Abraham Lincoln , who considered the Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy, and argued that the Declaration is a statement of principles through which the United States Constitution should be interpreted. It has inspired work for the rights of marginalized people throughout the world.","The Declaration of Independence is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, which announced that the thirteen American colonies , then at war with Great Britain , regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the British Empire .

The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia . The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia . Serbian military officers stood behind the attack. At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević , his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and Masterspy Rade Malobabić. Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary. The assassins, the key members of the clandestine tunnel, and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records. Assignment of responsibility for the bombing and murders of 28 June is highly controversial because the attack led to the outbreak of World War I one month later.","A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination and steps of Gavrilo Princip (image taken in 1987, before steps were removed in 1992 and plaque changed from Cyrillic to Latin script) A plaque commemorating the location of the Sarajevo assassination (image taken in 2009) ON 28 JUNE 1914, ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND OF AUSTRIA , HEIR PRESUMPTIVE TO THE AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN THRONE, AND HIS WIFE, SOPHIE, DUCHESS OF HOHENBERG , WERE SHOT DEAD IN SARAJEVO , BY GAVRILO PRINCIP , ONE OF A GROUP OF SIX BOSNIAN SERB ASSASSINS COORDINATED BY DANILO ILIĆ .

1534,Q2987,what is negligence in tort?,Negligence,"Negligence (Lat. negligentia, from neglegere, to neglect, literally ""not to pick up something"") is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances. The area of tort law known as negligence involves harm caused by carelessness, not intentional harm. According to Jay M. Feinman of the Rutgers University School of Law; ""The core idea of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care when they act by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause harm to other people."" ""those who go personally or bring property where they know that they or it may come into collision with the persons or property of others have by law a duty cast upon them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such a collision."" Fletcher v Rylands ([1866] LR 1 Ex 265) Through civil litigation, if an injured person proves that another person acted negligently to cause their injury, they can recover damages to compensate for their harm. Proving a case for negligence can potentially entitle the injured plaintiff to compensation for harm to their body, property, mental well-being, financial status, or intimate relationships. However, because negligence cases are very fact-specific, this general definition does not fully explain the concept of when the law will require one person to compensate another for losses caused by accidental injury. Further, the law of negligence at common law is only one aspect of the law of liability. Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action, the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases.","Negligence (Lat. negligentia, from neglegere, to neglect, literally ""not to pick up something"") is a failure to exercise the care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in like circumstances.

787,Q2018,what is the rationale for outsourcing in firms,outsourcing,"Outsourcing is the contracting out of an internal business process to a third-party organization. The practice of contracting a business process out to a third party rather than staffing it internally is common in the modern economy. The term ""outsourcing"" became popular in the United States near the turn of the 21st century. Outsourcing sometimes involves transferring employees and assets from one firm to another, but not always. The definition of outsourcing includes both foreign and domestic contracting, and sometimes includes offshoring , which means relocating a business function to another country. Financial savings from lower international labor rates is a big motivation for outsourcing/offshoring. The opposite of outsourcing is called insourcing , which entails bringing processes handled by third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration . However, a business can provide a contract service to another business without necessarily insourcing that business process.","Outsourcing is the contracting out of an internal business process to a third-party organization.

The ""electromagnetic spectrum"" of an object has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object. The electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short- wavelength (high-frequency) end, thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom . The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself, while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length , although in principle the spectrum is infinite and continuous . Most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions, as ways to study and characterize matter. In addition, radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing (see electromagnetic radiation for more applications).

2094,Q97,how big can texel guinea pigs become,List of guinea pig breeds,"A prize-winning lilac-and-white Silkie There are many breeds of Guinea pig which have been developed since its domestication ca. 5000 BC. Breeds vary widely in appearance and purpose, ranging from show breeds with long, flowing hair to those in use as model organisms by science. From ca. 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532, selective breeding by indigenous South American peoples resulted in many varieties of domestic Guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds. Early Andean breeds were primarily kept as agricultural stock for food, and efforts at improving the Guinea pig as a food source continue to the modern era. With the export of Guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets. To this end, various competitive breeding organizations were founded by fanciers. The American Cavy Breeders Association , an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders Association , is the governing body in the United States and Canada. The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council) and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Club). Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing. New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century. Though there are many breeds of Guinea pig, only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets. Most Guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable by breeders or were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they meet the breed standard of perfection. The short hair, Abyssinian, Peruvian and Sheltie (aka Silkie) breeds are those most frequently seen as pets, and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of Guinea pigs. In addition to their standard form, nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant. Satins, due to their hollow hair shafts, possess coats of a special gloss and shine. However, there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the Satin coat also can cause severe bone problems, including Osteodystrophy and Paget's disease . Showing Satin variations is prohibited by some cavy breeders' associations because of animal welfare reasons. All cavy breeds have some shared general standards: the head profile should be rounded, with large eyes and large, smooth ears. The body should be strong and of compact build. Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip. These standards are best met by long established, commonly bred breeds, as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities. The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth coated breeds, which have had well established, separate breeding lines for different colours.","A prize-winning lilac-and-white Silkie There are many breeds of Guinea pig which have been developed since its domestication ca. 5000 BC.

Staplers are widely used in government, business, offices , homes and schools . The word ""stapler"" can actually refer to a number of different devices of varying uses. In addition to joining paper sheets together, staplers can also be used in a surgical setting to join tissue together with surgical staples to close a surgical wound (much in the same way as stitches or sutures ). Typically, most staplers are used to join multiple sheets of paper. Paper staplers come in two distinct types: manual and electric. Manual staplers are normally hand-held, although models that are used while set on a desk or other surface are not uncommon. Electric staplers exist in a variety of different designs and models. Their primary operating function is to join large numbers of paper sheets together in rapid succession.

2070,Q943,how many innings makes an official game,Official game,"An official game in baseball , also sometimes called a regulation game, is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary. This is approximately the halfway point of the game. In the case of inclement weather , any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed, with the result being final, and all records and statistics counted. A game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game (to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage), or is simply canceled and replayed from the start. (This depends on the rules of each individual league .) In either case, no statistics are counted until the game becomes official. Since most professional baseball games are nine innings long, the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official game. If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point. If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 41⁄2 innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game. The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning, since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth. In nearly all cases, the ""official game"" status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets. If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official, fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or (in most cases) any other available game of their choice. If a game is halted after it becomes official, the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given. The ""official game"" statistic received some attention during the 1995 season, when Cal Ripken, Jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played , previously held by Lou Gehrig . Large numbers were hung on the side of the B&O Warehouse at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to show the number of games in Ripken's streak. Each day, a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official (since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point). A similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums (including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003, Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis in 2005, and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008); as each game became official, the team would unveil a new (lower) number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium.","An official game in baseball , also sometimes called a regulation game, is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessary.

If the visiting team is leading, or the game is tied, the end of the fifth inning marks this point. If the home team (which bats last) is already ahead in the score, and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning, then 41⁄2 innings (i.e., the middle of the fifth) is considered an official game. The game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning, since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninth. In nearly all cases, the ""official game"" status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding tickets. If a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official, fans are entitled to a new ticket for the make-up game or (in most cases) any other available game of their choice. If a game is halted after it becomes official, the game is simply shortened and no rain check is given. The ""official game"" statistic received some attention during the 1995 season, when Cal Ripken, Jr. was approaching the record for consecutive games played , previously held by Lou Gehrig . Large numbers were hung on the side of the B&O Warehouse at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to show the number of games in Ripken's streak. Each day, a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official (since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that point). A similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums (including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003, Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis in 2005, and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008); as each game became official, the team would unveil a new (lower) number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium.",True,True,1.8164678330067545,True,1.2380471660289913

1791,Q579,how poverty affects intelligence,Poverty,"An example of urban poverty in this slum in Jakarta , Indonesia Poverty is the state of one who lacks a certain amount of material possessions or money. Absolute poverty or destitution refers to the deprivation of basic human needs , which commonly includes food, water , sanitation, clothing, shelter, health care and education. Relative poverty is defined contextually as economic inequality in the location or society in which people live. For much of history, poverty was considered largely unavoidable as traditional modes of production were insufficient to give an entire population a comfortable standard of living. After the industrial revolution , mass production in factories made wealth increasingly more inexpensive and accessible. Of more importance is the modernization of agriculture , such as fertilizers , in order to provide enough yield to feed the population. The supply of basic needs can be restricted by constraints on government services such as corruption, tax avoidance , debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms, and providing financial services. Poverty reduction is a major goal and issue for many international organizations such as the United Nations and the World Bank . The World Bank estimated 1.29 billion people were living in absolute poverty in 2008. Of these, about 400 million people in absolute poverty lived in India and 173 million people in China. In USA 1 in 5 children lives in poverty. In terms of percentage of regional populations, sub-Saharan Africa at 47% had the highest incidence rate of absolute poverty in 2008.

604,Q1774,who overthrows france,Napoleon,"Imperial Standard of Napoleon I Napoleon Bonaparte ( , ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815. His legal reform, the Napoleonic Code , has been a major influence on many civil law jurisdictions worldwide, but he is best remembered for his role in the wars led against France by a series of coalitions, the so-called Napoleonic Wars . He established hegemony over most of continental Europe and sought to spread the ideals of the French Revolution, while consolidating an imperial monarchy which restored aspects of the deposed Ancien Régime . Due to his success in these wars, often against numerically superior enemies, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, and his campaigns are studied at military academies worldwide. Napoleon was born at Ajaccio in Corsica in a family of noble Italian ancestry which had settled Corsica in the 16th century. He trained as an artillery officer in mainland France. He rose to prominence under the French First Republic and led successful campaigns against the First and Second Coalitions arrayed against France. He led a successful invasion of the Italian peninsula. In 1799, he staged a coup d'état and installed himself as First Consul ; five years later the French Senate proclaimed him emperor, following a plebiscite in his favour. In the first decade of the 19th century, the French Empire under Napoleon engaged in a series of conflicts—the Napoleonic Wars —that involved every major European power. After a streak of victories, France secured a dominant position in continental Europe, and Napoleon maintained the French sphere of influence through the formation of extensive alliances and the appointment of friends and family members to rule other European countries as French client states . The Peninsular War and 1812 French invasion of Russia marked turning points in Napoleon's fortunes. His Grande Armée was badly damaged in the campaign and never fully recovered. In 1813, the Sixth Coalition defeated his forces at Leipzig ; the following year the Coalition invaded France, forced Napoleon to abdicate and exiled him to the island of Elba . Less than a year later, he escaped Elba and returned to power, but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. Napoleon spent the last six years of his life in confinement by the British on the island of Saint Helena . An autopsy concluded he died of stomach cancer , but there has been some debate about the cause of his death, as some scholars have speculated that he was a victim of arsenic poisoning .","Imperial Standard of Napoleon I Napoleon Bonaparte ( , ; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the latter stages of the French Revolution and its associated wars in Europe.

The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC . In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Stanley Cup.

1740,Q514,how do you know if a volcano is extinct,Volcano,"Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska photographed from the International Space Station , May 2006. Ash plumes reached a height of 19 km during the climactic eruption at Mount Pinatubo , Philippines in 1991. A volcano is an opening, or rupture , in a planet's surface or crust , which allows hot magma , volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface. Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging . A mid-oceanic ridge , for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust in the interiors of plates, e.g., in the East African Rift , the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in North America. This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of ""Plate hypothesis"" volcanism. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes . These so-called "" hotspots "", for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth. Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere ; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere . Historically, so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines .","Cleveland Volcano in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska photographed from the International Space Station , May 2006.

A volcano is an opening, or rupture , in a planet's surface or crust , which allows hot magma , volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface. Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging . A mid-oceanic ridge , for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge , has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust in the interiors of plates, e.g., in the East African Rift , the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in North America. This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of ""Plate hypothesis"" volcanism. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes . These so-called "" hotspots "", for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle boundary , 3,000 km deep in the Earth. Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere ; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere .

830,Q2071,where is mark sanchez from,Mark Sanchez,"Mark Travis John Sanchez (born November 11, 1986) is an American football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft as the fifth overall selection by the Jets and the second quarterback taken overall. He played college football at the University of Southern California (USC). Sanchez grew up in a well-disciplined and athletic family. In the eighth grade, he began to play football and learn the intricacies of the quarterback position, training with his father, Nick. A well-regarded prospect, Sanchez committed to Southern California following his successful high school career in which he led his team to a championship title during his final season. At USC, Sanchez was relegated as the backup quarterback during his first three years though he rose to prominence due to his brief appearances on the field in 2007 due to injuries suffered by starting quarterback John David Booty . Sanchez also became popular within the community due to his Mexican-American heritage. Named the starter in 2008, Sanchez led USC to a 12–1 record and won the Rose Bowl against Penn State for which Sanchez was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense . Although many considered him too inexperienced, Sanchez announced his intention to enter the 2009 NFL Draft . He was selected by the Jets after they traded up with the Cleveland Browns , and was named the starting quarterback prior to the start of the season . Despite a subpar performance, Sanchez led the Jets to the AFC Championship Game , a losing effort to the Indianapolis Colts , becoming the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first playoff game and the second to win two playoff games. In his second season, Sanchez continued to develop and led the Jets to the playoffs and the team's second consecutive AFC Championship Game where they narrowly lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers , 24–19. With the win over the New England Patriots the week prior, Sanchez tied four other quarterbacks for the second most post-season road victories by a quarterback in NFL history. In leading the Jets to two consecutive conference championships, Sanchez joined quarterback Ben Roethlisberger as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to reach the conference championship in their first two seasons in the league. The next two seasons would be a regression for both the team and Sanchez as they failed to reach the playoffs. Fans and media critics called for a struggling Sanchez to be benched.

1671,Q420,how much total wealth in USA,Wealth in the United States,"Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth , which is the sum of all assets , including home equity , minus all liabilities . The total net worth of US households and nonprofit organizations 1945–2009, unadjusted for inflation or population change. For example, a household in possession of an $800,000 house, $5,000 in mutual funds, $30,000 in cars, $20,000 worth of stock in their own company, and a $45,000 IRA would have assets totaling $900,000. Assuming that this household would have a $250,000 mortgage, $40,000 in car loans, and $10,000 in credit card debt, its debts would total $300,000. Subtracting the debts from the worth of this household's assets (900,000 - $300,000 = $600,000), this household would have a net worth of $600,000. Net worth can vary with fluctuations in value of the underlying assets. The wealth —more specifically, the median net worth—of households in the United States is varied with relation to race, education, geographic location and gender. As one would expect, households with greater income feature the highest net worths, though high income cannot be taken as an always accurate indicator of net worth. Overall the number of wealthier households is on the rise, with baby boomers hitting the highs of their careers. In addition, wealth is unevenly distributed, with the wealthiest 25% of US households owning 87% of the wealth in the United States, which was $54.2 trillion in 2009. Including human capital such as skills, the United Nations estimated the total wealth of the United States in 2008 to be $118 trillion.","Wealth in the United States is commonly measured in terms of net worth , which is the sum of all assets , including home equity , minus all liabilities .

1789,Q576,how many innings in overtime in baseball,Innings,"An inning, or innings, is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports – most notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring. In cricket, the term innings is both singular and plural and is always spelled and pronounced with the terminal ""s"". In baseball and softball , the singular form is inning and only the plural takes an ""s"". In many other sports, the length of the game is dictated by a clock and teams swap offensive and defensive roles dynamically by taking possession of a ball or similar item. In baseball and cricket, however, one team, said to be ""batting"", attempts to score ""runs""—see run (baseball) and run (cricket) —while the other team, said to be ""fielding"", attempts to prevent the scoring of runs and get members of the batting team out. The teams switch places after the fielding team has succeeded in getting a fixed number of players out, making a clock unnecessary. In cricket, the term innings is also used to refer to the play of one particular player (Smith had a poor innings, scoring only 12). By extension, this term can be used in British English for almost any activity which takes a period of time (The Liberal government had a good innings, but finally lost office in 1972, or You've had a fair innings, now it's my turn, meaning ""you have spoken for long enough, now let me speak""). It is also used in reference to someone who has died at a reasonably old age or lived a rich and rewarding life (Ah, well. John was 89. At least he had a good innings). The baseball-derived parallel to this in American English is the term at bat . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term innings has been used in reference to cricket since at least 1735. As cricket was a mature, highly organized sport in the 1600s in England, the term's origin could well precede this first recorded usage. The word inning meaning 'a gathering in' is first recorded in 1522, and could be related.","An inning, or innings, is a fixed-length segment of a game in any of a variety of sports – most notably cricket and baseball during which one team attempts to score while the other team attempts to prevent the first from scoring.

288,Q1367,what state is new england in,New England,"Autumn in New England, watercolor, Maurice Prendergast . Ca. 1910–1913 Fall foliage in the town of Stowe, Vermont New England is a region in the northeastern corner of the United States consisting of the six states of Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Massachusetts , Rhode Island , and Connecticut . New England is bordered by New York state to the southwest, Quebec to the northwest, and New Brunswick and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. In one of the earliest English settlements in North America, Pilgrims from England first settled in New England in 1620, to form Plymouth Colony . Ten years later, the Puritans settled north of Plymouth Colony in Boston , thus forming Massachusetts Bay Colony . Over the next 130 years, New England fought in four French and Indian Wars , until the British defeated the French and their native allies in North America. In the late 18th century, the New England Colonies initiated the resistance to the British Parliament's efforts to impose new taxes without the consent of the colonists . The Boston Tea Party was a protest to which Great Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government, which were termed the "" Intolerable Acts "" by the colonists. The confrontation led to open warfare in 1775, the expulsion of the British authorities from New England in spring 1776, and the Declaration of Independence in July 1776. Some of the first movements of American literature , philosophy , and education originated in New England. The region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery , and was the first region of the United States to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution . Today, New England is a major world center of education, high technology, insurance, and medicine. Boston is its cultural, financial, educational, medical and transportation center. Each state is principally subdivided into small incorporated municipalities known as New England towns , which are often governed by town meeting . The only unincorporated territory in New England exists in the sparse, northern regions of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Since 1970, voters have more often supported liberal candidates at the state and federal level than those of any other region in the United States. New England is the only one of the United States Census Bureau 's nine regional divisions whose name does not derive from its geography, and it is the only multi-state region with clear, consistent boundaries. It maintains a strong sense of cultural identity set apart from the rest of the country, although the terms of this identity are often contested, combining Puritanism with liberalism, agrarian life with industry, and isolation with immigration.","Autumn in New England, watercolor, Maurice Prendergast .

802,Q2038,what is reagan known for,Presidency of Ronald Reagan,"The United States presidency of Ronald Reagan , also known as the Reagan administration, was a Republican administration headed by Ronald Reagan from January 20, 1981, to January 20, 1989. Domestically, the administration favored reducing government programs and introduced the largest across-the-board tax cuts in American history. The economic policies enacted in 1981, known as "" Reaganomics "", were an example of supply-side economics . Reagan aimed to encourage entrepreneurship and limit the growth of social spending, as well as the reduction of regulation and inflation . Economic growth saw a strong recovery in the 1980s, helping Reagan to win a landslide re-election . The national debt increased significantly, however. Regarding foreign policy , the administration was steadfastly anti-communist , calling the Soviet Union an "" evil empire "" and ending 1970s détente . Reagan accelerated the massive buildup of the military started by his predecessor , including an invasion of Grenada , the first major overseas action by U.S. troops since the end of the Vietnam War . The "" Reagan Doctrine "" controversially granted aid to paramilitary forces seeking to overthrow communist governments, particularly in war-torn Central America and Afghanistan . Reagan also promoted new technologies such as missile defense systems in order to confront the Soviets and their allies. In diplomacy, Reagan forged a strong alliance with UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , and he met with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev four times, aiming to shrink the superpowers ' nuclear arsenals. Reagan's presidency has been termed the ""Reagan Revolution"", or the Age of Reagan in recognition of the political realignment both within and beyond the U.S. in favor of his brand of conservatism and his faith in free markets . The Reagan administration worked toward the collapse of Soviet Communism, and it did collapse just as he left office. Victory in the Cold War led to a unipolar world with the U.S. as the world's sole superpower. While the damaging Iran-Contra affair engulfed several Reagan aides during his second term, Reagan himself left office with a 63 percent approval rating , one of the higher approval ratings of departing presidents. After years of unstinting praise from the right, and unrelenting criticism from the left, historian David Henry finds that by 2009 a consensus had emerged among scholars that Reagan revived conservatism and turned the nation to the right by demonstrating a ""pragmatic conservatism"" that promoted ideology within the constraints imposed by the divided political system.

The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's south-Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Greater Serbia or a Yugoslavia . The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia . Serbian military officers stood behind the attack. At the top of these Serbian military conspirators was Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijević , his righthand man Major Vojislav Tankosić, and Masterspy Rade Malobabić. Major Tankosić armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were given access to the same clandestine tunnel of safe-houses and agents that Rade Malobabić used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary. The assassins, the key members of the clandestine tunnel, and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian kangaroo court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.

1102,Q2412,where was the first canal in panama located,Panama Canal,"Location of Panama between Pacific (bottom) and Caribbean (top), with canal at top center The Panama Canal () is a ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean (via the Caribbean Sea ) to the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake ( above sea-level). Gatun Lake was created to reduce the amount of work required for the canal. The current locks are wide. A third, wider lane of locks is being built. France began work on the canal in 1881, but had to stop because of engineering problems and high mortality due to disease. The United States (US) later took over the project and took a decade to complete the canal in 1914, enabling ships to avoid the lengthy Cape Horn route around the southernmost tip of South America (via the Drake Passage ) or to navigate the Strait of Magellan . One of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken, the Panama Canal shortcut made it possible for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in half the time previously required. The shorter, faster, safer route to the US West Coast and to nations in and along the Pacific Ocean allowed those places to become more integrated with the world economy. During this time, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American; the United States completed the construction. The canal was taken over in 1999 by the Panamanian government, as long planned. Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships when the canal opened in 1914, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons . By 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal, many of them much larger than the original planners could have envisioned; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax .

During this time, ownership of the territory that is now the Panama Canal was first Colombian, then French, and then American; the United States completed the construction. The canal was taken over in 1999 by the Panamanian government, as long planned. Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships when the canal opened in 1914, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, the latter measuring a total of 309.6 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons . By 2008, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal, many of them much larger than the original planners could have envisioned; the largest ships that can transit the canal today are called Panamax . The American Society of Civil Engineers has named the Panama Canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world .",False,False,2.2184362919651903,True,1.3620719999889843

Printmaking normally covers only the process of creating prints with an element of originality, rather than just being a photographic reproduction of a painting. Except in the case of monotyping , the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece, which is called a print. Each print produced is not considered a ""copy"" but rather is considered an ""original"". This is because typically each print varies to an extent due to variables intrinsic to the printmaking process, and also because the imagery of a print is typically not simply a reproduction of another work but rather is often a unique image designed from the start to be expressed in a particular printmaking technique. A print may be known as an impression. Printmaking (other than monotyping) is not chosen only for its ability to produce multiple impressions, but rather for the unique qualities that each of the printmaking processes lends itself to. Prints are created by transferring ink from a matrix or through a prepared screen to a sheet of paper or other material. Common types of matrices include: metal plates, usually copper or zinc, or polymer plates for engraving or etching ; stone, aluminum, or polymer for lithography ; blocks of wood for woodcuts and wood engravings ; and linoleum for linocuts . Screens made of silk or synthetic fabrics are used for the screenprinting process. Other types of matrix substrates and related processes are discussed below. Multiple impressions printed from the same matrix form an edition . Since the late 19th century, artists have generally signed individual impressions from an edition and often number the impressions to form a limited edition . Prints may also be printed in book form, such as illustrated books or artist's books .","Mount Fuji , from the Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji , color woodcut by Katsushika Hokusai Rembrandt van Rijn , Self-portrait , etching , c.1630 Francisco Goya , There is No One To Help Them, Disasters of War series, aquatint c.1810 Felix Vallotton , La raison probante (The Cogent Reason), woodcut from the series Intimités, 1898 Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing , normally on paper .

1730,Q50,how long was richard nixon a president,Richard Nixon,"Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th President of the United States , serving from 1969 to 1974, when he became the only president to resign the office. Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961. Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California. He graduated from Whittier College in 1934 and Duke University School of Law in 1937, returning to California to practice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon , moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942. He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II . Nixon was elected in California to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 . His pursuit of the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election . Nixon served for eight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962 . In 1968, he ran again for the presidency and was elected . Although Nixon initially escalated America's involvement in the Vietnam War , he subsequently ended U.S. involvement in 1973. Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. Domestically, his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states. Among other things, he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs , imposed wage and price controls, enforced desegregation of some Southern schools, and established the Environmental Protection Agency . Though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with Apollo 11 , he scaled back manned space exploration. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972. Nixon's second term saw an Arab oil embargo , the resignation of his vice president, Spiro Agnew , and a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal and other misconduct by members of the administration. The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he controversially received a pardon issued by his successor, Gerald Ford . In retirement, Nixon's work as an elder statesman , authoring several books and undertaking many foreign trips, helped to rehabilitate his public image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.","RICHARD MILHOUS NIXON (JANUARY 9, 1913 – APRIL 22, 1994) WAS THE 37TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , SERVING FROM 1969 TO 1974, WHEN HE BECAME THE ONLY PRESIDENT TO RESIGN THE OFFICE.

It has diverse meanings, ranging from a normal human being to a prophesied eternal, divine ruler. The Hebrew expression ""son of man"" (בן–אדם i.e. ben-'adam) appears one hundred and seven times in the Hebrew Bible . This is the most common Hebrew construction for the singular but is used mostly in Ezekiel (93 times) and 14 times elsewhere. In thirty two cases the phrase appears in intermediate plural form ""sons of men"", i.e. human beings. As generally interpreted by Jews, it denotes humankind generally. In the Koine Greek of the New Testament , ""the son of man"" is invariably used as ""ὁ υἱὸς τοὺ ἀνθρώπου"" with a definite article. The use of the definite article in ""the son of man"" in the Christian gospels is novel, and before its use there, no records of its use in any of the surviving Greek documents of antiquity exist. Geza Vermes has stated that ""the Son of man"" in the Christian gospels is unrelated to Hebrew Bible usages. In Christian usage , unlike the Son of God title, which has been an essential element of Christian creeds since the Apostolic age , the proclamation of ""Jesus as the Son of man"" has never been an article of faith in Christianity . The interpretation of the use of ""the Son of man"" in the New Testament has remained challenging and after 150 years of debate no consensus on the issue has emerged among scholars.","Front page of a 17th century Hebrew Bible by Joseph Athias , now at Beth Hatefutsoth , Israel 'Son of man' is the translation of various Hebrew and Greek phrases used in both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament .

1203,Q2544,what is high sticking in hockey,High-Sticking,"A referee calling a high-sticking penaltyHigh -sticking is the name of two infractions in the sport of ice hockey that may occur when a player intentionally or inadvertently plays with his or her stick above the height of the shoulders or above the cross bar of a hockey goal. This can result in a stoppage of play or in a penalty. In the rules of the National Hockey League , high-sticking is defined as a penalty in Rule 60 and as a non-penalty foul in Rule 80. A stoppage in play results if a high stick comes in contact with the puck and the team who touched it regains control of the puck. However, play usually continues if a player touches the puck with a high stick and the opposing team gains control of the puck. If the puck goes into the opposing net after coming into contact with a high stick, the goal is disallowed. The level at which a stick is considered too high for a goal is the crossbar of the net. However, if a player knocks the puck into his own net with a high stick, the goal is allowed. A penalty is assessed if a player strikes another player with a high stick. The player is given a minor penalty unless his high stick caused an injury, in which case the referee has the option to assess a double-minor, major or match penalty. It is the referee's discretion which penalty to assess: the rule calls for a double minor for an accidental injury, or a match penalty for a deliberate attempt to injure (whether the opposition player was actually injured). Injury is usually decided by the high stick causing bleeding, but the presence of blood does not automatically mean an extra penalty is awarded. Some referees have been known to award an extra penalty without the presence of blood if the referee determines that the injury sustained was sufficient to warrant a double-minor penalty.","A referee calling a high-sticking penaltyHigh -STICKING IS THE NAME OF TWO INFRACTIONS IN THE SPORT OF ICE HOCKEY THAT MAY OCCUR WHEN A PLAYER INTENTIONALLY OR INADVERTENTLY PLAYS WITH HIS OR HER STICK ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF THE SHOULDERS OR ABOVE THE CROSS BAR OF A HOCKEY GOAL.

2063,Q937,what did bull run end for the north,First Battle of Bull Run,"The First Battle of Bull Run, also known as First Manassas (the name used by Confederate forces), was fought on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia , near the city of Manassas . It was the first major land battle of the American Civil War . Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter , the Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia , which they expected to bring an early end to the rebellion. Yielding to political pressure, Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction. McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed by his officers and men; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage. Confederate reinforcements under Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad and the course of the battle quickly changed. A brigade of Virginians under a relatively unknown colonel from the Virginia Military Institute , Thomas J. Jackson , stood their ground and Jackson received his famous nickname, ""Stonewall Jackson"". The Confederates then launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and it turned into a rout as McDowell's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C.

736,Q195,how is canada's health care,Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States,"Health spending per capita, in $US PPP-adjusted , with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations. Comparison of the health care systems in Canada and the United States are often made by government, public health and public policy analysts . The two countries had similar health care systems before Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s. The United States spends much more money on health care than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP. In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714. The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on health care in that year; Canada spent 10.0%. In 2006, 70% of health care spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on health care was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on health care was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics don't take into account population differences. Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending. A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that ""health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent."" Life expectancy is longer in Canada, and its infant mortality rate is lower than that of the U.S., but there is debate about the underlying causes of these differences. One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of ""overall health service performance"", which used a ""composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution"", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations. This study rated the US ""responsiveness"", or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada. While the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US, simply comparing the life expectancy of two groups with different racial makeup and different obesity rates is likely not an effective way of determining which healthcare system is superior. The WHO's study methods were criticized by some analyses. Although there is a measure of consensus that life-expectancy and infant mortality mark the most reliable ways to compare nation-wide health care, assuming the population makeup is similar, a recent report by the Congressional Research Service carefully summarizes some recent data and notes the ""difficult research issues"" facing international comparisons.","Health spending per capita, in $US PPP-adjusted , with the US and Canada compared amongst other first world nations.

1739,Q513,how did the vietnam war end,Vietnam War,"The Vietnam War () was a Cold War -era military conflict that occurred in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975. This war followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam , supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam , supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The Viet Cong (also known as the National Liberation Front, or NLF), a lightly armed South Vietnamese communist common front directed by the North, largely fought a guerrilla war against anti-communist forces in the region. The Vietnam People's Army (North Vietnamese Army) engaged in a more conventional war , at times committing large units into battle. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces , artillery , and airstrikes . The U.S. government viewed involvement in the war as a way to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of containment . The North Vietnamese government and Viet Cong were fighting to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. They viewed the conflict as a colonial war , fought initially against France, backed by the U.S., and later against South Vietnam, which it regarded as a U.S. puppet state . American military advisors arrived in what was then French Indochina beginning in 1950. U.S. involvement escalated in the early 1960s, with troop levels tripling in 1961 and tripling again in 1962. U.S. combat units were deployed beginning in 1965. Operations spanned international borders, with Laos and Cambodia heavily bombed. American involvement in the war peaked in 1968, at the time of the Tet Offensive . After this, U.S. ground forces were gradually withdrawn as part of a policy known as Vietnamization . Despite the Paris Peace Accords , signed by all parties in January 1973, fighting continued. U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 as a result of the Case–Church Amendment passed by the U.S. Congress. The capture of Saigon by the Vietnam People's Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year. The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see Vietnam War casualties ). Estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 800,000 to 3.1 million. Some 200,000–300,000 Cambodians , 20,000–200,000 Laotians , and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict.","The Vietnam War () was a Cold War -era military conflict that occurred in Vietnam , Laos , and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.

227,Q1291,when do i plant triticale,Triticale,"Triticale (× Triticosecale), () is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century. The grain was originally bred in Scotland and Sweden . Commercially available triticale is almost always a second generation hybrid, i.e., a cross between two kinds of primary (first cross) triticales. As a rule, triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye . Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop. Depending on the cultivar , triticale can more or less resemble either of its parents. It is grown mostly for forage or fodder , although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals . When crossing wheat and rye, wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent (pollen donor). The resulting hybrid is sterile , and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itself. The primary producers of triticale are Poland , Germany , France , Belarus and Australia . In 2009, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 15.0 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the world. The triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid , which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species . In other words, triticale is an allotetraploid . In earlier years, most work was done on octoploid triticale. Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time. The tetraploids showed little promise, but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial application. The CIMMYT triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries . Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products, such as cookies , pasta , pizza dough and breakfast cereals . The protein content is higher than that of wheat , although the glutenin fraction is less. The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat. Assuming increased acceptance, the milling industry will have to adapt to triticale, as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticale. Sell et al. found triticale could be used as a feed grain , and later research found its starch was particularly readily digested. As a feed grain, triticale is already well established and of high economic importance. It has received attention as a potential energy crop , and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crop's biomass in bioethanol production.","Triticale (× Triticosecale), () is a hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in laboratories during the late 19th century.

2004,Q847,what contributes to high blood pressure,Blood pressure,"Blood pressure (BP), sometimes referred to as arterial blood pressure, is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels , and is one of the principal vital signs . When used without further specification, ""blood pressure"" usually refers to the arterial pressure of the systemic circulation . During each heartbeat, blood pressure varies between a maximum ( systolic ) and a minimum ( diastolic ) pressure. The blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart. Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles . Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during standing) and valves in veins, breathing , and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins. Blood pressure without further specification usually refers to the systemic arterial pressure measured at a person's upper arm and is a measure of the pressure in the brachial artery , the major artery in the upper arm. A person’s blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure over diastolic pressure and is measured in millimetres of mercury ( mmHg ), for example 120/80.","Blood pressure (BP), sometimes referred to as arterial blood pressure, is the pressure exerted by circulating blood upon the walls of blood vessels , and is one of the principal vital signs .

1360,Q2754,who is the inside guy on people's court,The People's Court,"The People's Court is an American arbitration-based reality court show , currently presided over by retired Florida State Circuit Court Judge Marilyn Milian , in which small claims disputes are handled. The People's Court is the first court show to use binding arbitration , introducing the format into the genre in 1981. The system has been duplicated by most of the show's successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, The People's Court is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived predecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings, except for one: Parole (1959) took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings. Prior to The People's Court, the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used actors , and recreated or fictional cases (as did radio before that ). Among examples of these types of court shows include Famous Jury Trials and Your Witness . The People's Court has had two contrasting lives. The show's first life was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner . His tenure lasted from the show's debut on September 14, 1981, until May 21, 1993, when the show was cancelled due to low ratings. This left the show with a total of 2,484 1⁄2-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life. After being cancelled , reruns aired until September 9, 1994. On September 8, 1997, after being out of production for four years, The People's Court was revived for a second life in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program. Former lawyer and Mayor of New York Ed Koch was chosen as arbiter, which he maintained for 2 seasons from the 1997–98 season through the 1998–99 season (the present life's 2nd season and overall show's 14th). By the 1999–00 season, husband of Judith Sheindlin (who presides over Judge Judy ) and former New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin succeeded Koch. Sheindlin lasted one and a half seasons as he was replaced towards the end of the 2000–01 season (present life's 4th season and overall show's 17th). Beginning in spring 2001, Florida judge Marilyn Milian took over The People's Court and has presided over the show ever since. Once Milian completes the 2012–13 season, she will have served as longest arbiter over the series with 12 and a half seasons. As of the present, however, her years on the program tie Wapner at 12 seasons. In the 2009-10 television season, The People's Courts 2nd/present life outlasted its first when it reached 13 seasons. While the show taped in New York City for the first 15 seasons of its second life, it now tapes in Stamford, Connecticut as of the 2012-13 season. On September 3, 2012, The People's Court's 2nd/present life entered its 16th season (28th overall season).

This left the show with a total of 2,484 1⁄2-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life. After being cancelled , reruns aired until September 9, 1994. On September 8, 1997, after being out of production for four years, The People's Court was revived for a second life in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program. Former lawyer and Mayor of New York Ed Koch was chosen as arbiter, which he maintained for 2 seasons from the 1997–98 season through the 1998–99 season (the present life's 2nd season and overall show's 14th). By the 1999–00 season, husband of Judith Sheindlin (who presides over Judge Judy ) and former New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin succeeded Koch. Sheindlin lasted one and a half seasons as he was replaced towards the end of the 2000–01 season (present life's 4th season and overall show's 17th). Beginning in spring 2001, Florida judge Marilyn Milian took over The People's Court and has presided over the show ever since. Once Milian completes the 2012–13 season, she will have served as longest arbiter over the series with 12 and a half seasons. As of the present, however, her years on the program tie Wapner at 12 seasons. In the 2009-10 television season, The People's Courts 2nd/present life outlasted its first when it reached 13 seasons. While the show taped in New York City for the first 15 seasons of its second life, it now tapes in Stamford, Connecticut as of the 2012-13 season. On September 3, 2012, The People's Court's 2nd/present life entered its 16th season (28th overall season). With 28 total seasons, The People's Court ranks as the 2nd longest-running courtroom program behind the ongoing Divorce Court at 33 seasons (from its 3 combined lives).",False,True,2.3493747909669764,True,1.4606365420040675
1234,Q2586,what is compatible with directx 9.0b,DirectX,"Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia , especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with Direct, such as Direct3D , DirectDraw , DirectMusic , DirectPlay , DirectSound , and so forth. The name DirectX was coined as shorthand term for all of these APIs (the X standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the X was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology. The X initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite . Direct3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows , Microsoft Xbox , Microsoft Xbox 360 and some Sega Dreamcast games. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names ""DirectX"" and ""Direct3D"" used interchangeably. The DirectX software development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2. Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples. Starting with the release of Windows 8 Developer Preview, DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows SDK. Direct3D 9Ex, Direct3D 10, and Direct3D 11 are only available for Windows Vista and newer because each of these new versions was built to depend upon the new Windows Display Driver Model that was introduced for Windows Vista.

463,Q1589,when Harry met Sally case,When Harry Met Sally...,"When Harry Met Sally... is a 1989 American romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner . It stars Billy Crystal as Harry and Meg Ryan as Sally. The story follows the title characters from the time they meet just before sharing a cross-country drive, through twelve years or so of chance encounters in New York City . The film raises the question ""Can men and women ever just be friends?"" and advances many ideas about relationships that became household concepts, such as those of the """" girlfriend and the ""transitional person"". The origins of the film came from Reiner's return to single life after a divorce. An interview Ephron conducted with Reiner provided the basis for Harry. Sally was based on Ephron and some of her friends. Crystal came on board and made his own contributions to the screenplay, making Harry funnier. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick, Jr. , with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman . Connick won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance . Columbia Pictures released the film using the ""platform"" technique, which involved opening it in a few select cities, letting positive word of mouth generate interest, and then gradually expanding distribution over subsequent weeks. When Harry Met Sally... grossed a total of US$92 .8 million in North America.

1312,Q2690,what is darwin's origin of species,On the Origin of Species,"On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology . Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection . It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution . Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. Various evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology . There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England , while science was part of natural theology . Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream. The book was written for non-specialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific, philosophical, and religious discussion. The debate over the book contributed to the campaign by T.H. Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism . Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution, with a branching pattern of common descent, had occurred, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriate. During the "" eclipse of Darwinism "" from the 1880s to the 1930s, various other mechanisms of evolution were given more credit. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory, now the unifying concept of the life sciences .","On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology .

1335,Q2719,what is in caffeine,Caffeine,"Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid that acts as a stimulant drug. Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators. It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the leaves of the tea bush , as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut . Other sources include yerba maté , guarana berries, guayusa , and the yaupon holly . In humans, caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant, temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug , but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee , tea , soft drinks , and energy drinks , enjoy great popularity. In North America, 90% of adults consume caffeine daily. Part of the reason caffeine is classified by the Food and Drug Administration as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) is that toxic doses (over 10 grams) are much higher than typically used doses (less than 500 milligrams). Ordinary consumption can have low health risks, even when carried on for years – there may be a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinsons Disease , and certain types of cancer . Caffeine can have both positive and negative effects on anxiety disorders. Some people experience sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance and the effect of caffeine on sleep is highly variable. Evidence of a risk to pregnancy is equivocal, but some authorities have concluded that prudent advice is for pregnant women to limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women. Caffeine has pressor and mild diuretic effects when administered to people who are not used to it, but regular users develop a tolerance to this effect, and studies have generally failed to support the common notion that ordinary consumption contributes significantly to dehydration . With heavy use, tolerance develops rapidly to autonomic effects such as elevated heart rate and muscle twitching, but not to the cognitive or arousal effects of caffeine. The degree to which caffeine can produce clinically significant physical and mental dependence remains a subject of controversy in the medical literature.","Caffeine is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid that acts as a stimulant drug.

Both flasks are submerged in a dry ice/acetone cooling bath (−78 °C) the temperature of which is being monitored by a thermocouple (the wire on the left). A cooling bath, in laboratory chemistry (often but not always organic chemistry ) practice, is a liquid mixture which is used to maintain low temperatures, typically between 13 °C and −196 °C. These low temperatures are used to collect liquids after distillation , to remove solvents using a rotary evaporator , or to perform a chemical reaction below room temperature (see: kinetic control ). Cooling baths are generally one of two types: (a) a cold fluid (particularly liquid nitrogen , water , or even air ) — but most commonly the term refers to (b) a mixture of 3 components: (1) a cooling agent (such as dry ice or water ice ); (b) a liquid 'carrier' (such as liquid water, ethylene glycol, acetone, etc.), which transfers heat between the bath and the vessel; ; and (c) an additive to depress the melting-point of the solid/liquid system. (A familiar example of this is the use of an ice/rock-salt mixture to freeze ice cream. The phase-change of ice into liquid water requires energy, 'pulling' heat from the system. Adding salt lowers the temp at which this happens, meaning more energy has to be absorbed from the environment in order to melt the ice.

1980,Q815,how many percent is a basis point,Basis point,"A basis point (often denoted as bp, colloquially referred to in the plural as ""bips"", also known as a ""beep"") is a unit equal to one hundredth of a percentage point , or one part per ten thousand , 1/10000. The same unit is also (rarely) called a permyriad, literally meaning 'for (every) myriad (ten thousand)', and in that context is written with which looks like a percent sign (%) with two extra zeroes at the end (like a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator , although it originates as a natural extension of the percent (%) and permille (‰) signs). A basis point is defined as: 1 basis point = 1 permyriad = one one-hundredth percent 1 bp = 1 = 0.01% = 0.1‰ = 10−4 = = 0.0001 1% = 100 bp = 100 Basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1% are discussed. The most common example is interest rates , where differences in interest rates of less than 1% per year are usually meaningful to talk about. For example, a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points (e.g. a 4.67% rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77%). Like percentage points , basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate. For example, if a report says there has been a ""1% increase"" from a 10% interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10% to 10.1% (relative, 1% of 10%), or from 10% to 11% (absolute, 1% plus 10%). If, however, the report says there has been a ""10 basis point increase"" from a 10% interest rate, then we know that the interest rate of 10% has increased by 0.10% (the absolute change) to a 10.1% rate. It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument , or the difference ( spread ) between two interest rates, including the yields of fixed-income securities . Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security , they will often be quoted as a spread over (or under) the index. For example, a loan that bears interest of 0.50% per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR, which is commonly expressed as ""L+50bps"" or simply ""L+50"". The term ""basis point"" has its origins in trading the ""basis"" or the spread between two interest rates. Since the basis is usually small, these are quoted multiplied up by 10000, and hence a ""full point"" movement in the ""basis"" is a basis point. Contrast with pips in FX forward markets. The relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows: 1 percentage point change = 100 basis points, and 0.01 percentage points = 1 basis point. So, a bond whose yield increases from 5% to 5.5% is said to increase by 50 basis points; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points.","A basis point (often denoted as bp, colloquially referred to in the plural as ""bips"", also known as a ""beep"") is a unit equal to one hundredth of a percentage point , or one part per ten thousand , 1/10000.

If, however, the report says there has been a ""10 basis point increase"" from a 10% interest rate, then we know that the interest rate of 10% has increased by 0.10% (the absolute change) to a 10.1% rate. It is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument , or the difference ( spread ) between two interest rates, including the yields of fixed-income securities . Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security , they will often be quoted as a spread over (or under) the index. For example, a loan that bears interest of 0.50% per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR, which is commonly expressed as ""L+50bps"" or simply ""L+50"". The term ""basis point"" has its origins in trading the ""basis"" or the spread between two interest rates. Since the basis is usually small, these are quoted multiplied up by 10000, and hence a ""full point"" movement in the ""basis"" is a basis point. Contrast with pips in FX forward markets. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERCENTAGE CHANGES AND BASIS POINTS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS: 1 PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE = 100 BASIS POINTS, AND 0.01 PERCENTAGE POINTS = 1 BASIS POINT. So, a bond whose yield increases from 5% to 5.5% is said to increase by 50 basis points; or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points.",True,True,1.5203200000105426,True,1.1188751659938134

474,Q160,how many people died at the pentagon in 9 11,September 11 attacks,"The September 11 attacks (also referred to as September 11, September 11th, or 9/11) were a series of four coordinated terrorist attacks launched by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda upon the United States in New York City and the Washington, D.C. area on September 11, 2001. Four passenger airliners were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists so they could be flown into buildings in suicide attacks . Two of those planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 , were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within two hours, both towers collapsed with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the WTC complex, as well as major damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77 , was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense ), leading to a partial collapse in its western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93 , was targeted at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania , after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. In total, almost 3,000 people died in the attacks , including the 227 civilians and 19 hijackers aboard the four planes. Suspicion quickly fell on al-Qaeda. Although the group's leader, Osama bin Laden , initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he claimed responsibility for the attacks . Al-Qaeda and bin Laden cited U.S. support of Israel , the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia , and sanctions against Iraq as motives for the attacks. The United States responded to the attacks by launching the War on Terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban , which had harbored al-Qaeda. Many countries strengthened their anti-terrorism legislation and expanded law enforcement powers. Having evaded capture for years, bin Laden was located and killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. The destruction of the Twin Towers and other properties caused serious damage to the economy of Lower Manhattan and had a significant effect on global markets.

1701,Q466,what antibodies are produced in large quantities,Antibody,"Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key. An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B-cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses . The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target, called an antigen . Each tip of the ""Y"" of an antibody contains a paratope (a structure analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell . Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell, and a membrane -bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms. Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily ; the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeably. Antibodies are typically made of basic structural units—each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains . There are several different types of antibody heavy chains, and several different kinds of antibodies, which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess. Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals, which perform different roles, and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter. Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar, a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable, allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures, or antigen binding sites, to exist. This region is known as the hypervariable region. Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen. This enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens. The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites (or paratopes), followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene, which create further diversity. Antibody genes also re-organize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region. This allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system.","Each antibody binds to a specific antigen ; an interaction similar to a lock and key.

149,Q1189,what is a full job time??,Full-time,"Full-time employment is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by his/her employer. Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time , temporary , or flexible workers, such as annual leave , sickleave , and health insurance . Full-time jobs are often considered careers . They generally pay more than part-time jobs, and usually carry more hours per week. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 30–35 or 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits. Full-Time status varies between company and is often based on the shift the employee must work during each work week. The ""standard"" work week consists of five eight-hour days , commonly served between 9:00AM to 5:00PM totaling 40 hours. While a four-day week generally consists of four ten-hour days; it may also consist of as little as nine hours for a total of a 36 hour work week. Twelve-hour shifts are often three days per week, unless the company has the intention of paying out the employee overtime. Overtime is legally paid out anytime an employee works more than 40 hours per week. The legal minimum for overtime starts at Base Pay + One-Half. The increased payout is considered to compensate slightly for the increased fatigue which a person experiences on such long shifts. Shifts can also be very irregular, as in retail , but are still full-time if the required number of hours is reached. There are some situations where a person who needs full-time work is dropped to part-time, which is sometimes a form of constructive dismissal to avoid paying unemployment benefits to a laid-off worker.","FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT IS EMPLOYMENT IN WHICH A PERSON WORKS A MINIMUM NUMBER OF HOURS DEFINED AS SUCH BY HIS/HER EMPLOYER.

67,Q1075,where did the persian war take place,Greco-Persian Wars,"The Greco-Persian Wars (also often called the Persian Wars) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire of Persia and city-states of the Hellenic world that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC. The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered Ionia in 547 BC. Struggling to rule the independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike. In 499 BC, the then tyrant of Miletus , Aristagoras , embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos , with Persian support; however, the expedition was a debacle and, pre-empting his dismissal, Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians. This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt , which would last until 493 BC, progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict. Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria , and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis . The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act. The revolt continued, with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497–495 BC. In 494 BC, the Persians regrouped, and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus. At the Battle of Lade , the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat, and the rebellion collapsed, with the final members being stamped out the following year. Seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks, Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for burning Sardis. The first Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC, with the Persian general Mardonius conquering Thrace and Macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the campaign. In 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece, this time across the Aegean Sea , under the command of Datis and Artaphernes . This expedition subjugated the Cyclades , before besieging, capturing and razing Eretria. However, while en route to attack Athens, the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon , ending Persian efforts for the time being. Darius then began to plan to complete the conquest of Greece, but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes I . In 480 BC, Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled. Victory over the 'Allied' Greek states (led by Sparta and Athens) at the Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch Athens and overrun most of Greece. However, while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis . The following year, the confederated Greeks went on the offensive, defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea , and ending the invasion of Greece. The allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale , before expelling Persian garrisons from Sestos (479 BC) and Byzantium (478 BC). The actions of the general Pausanias at the siege of Byzantium alienated many of the Greek states from the Spartans, and the anti-Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership, as the so-called Delian League . The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades, beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe. At the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC, the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of Ionia. However, the League's involvement in an Egyptian revolt (from 460–454 BC) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended. A fleet was sent to Cyprus in 451 BC, but achieved little, and when it withdrew the Greco-Persian Wars drew to a quiet end. Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia, the so-called Peace of Callias .","THE GRECO-PERSIAN WARS (ALSO OFTEN CALLED THE PERSIAN WARS) WERE A SERIES OF CONFLICTS BETWEEN THE ACHAEMENID EMPIRE OF PERSIA AND CITY-STATES OF THE HELLENIC WORLD THAT STARTED IN 499 BC AND LASTED UNTIL 449 BC.

Victory over the 'Allied' Greek states (led by Sparta and Athens) at the Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch Athens and overrun most of Greece. However, while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis . The following year, the confederated Greeks went on the offensive, defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea , and ending the invasion of Greece. The allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale , before expelling Persian garrisons from Sestos (479 BC) and Byzantium (478 BC). THE ACTIONS OF THE GENERAL PAUSANIAS AT THE SIEGE OF BYZANTIUM ALIENATED MANY OF THE GREEK STATES FROM THE SPARTANS, AND THE ANTI-PERSIAN ALLIANCE WAS THEREFORE RECONSTITUTED AROUND ATHENIAN LEADERSHIP, AS THE SO-CALLED DELIAN LEAGUE . The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades, beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe. AT THE BATTLE OF THE EURYMEDON IN 466 BC, THE LEAGUE WON A DOUBLE VICTORY THAT FINALLY SECURED FREEDOM FOR THE CITIES OF IONIA. However, the League's involvement in an Egyptian revolt (from 460–454 BC) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended. A FLEET WAS SENT TO CYPRUS IN 451 BC, BUT ACHIEVED LITTLE, AND WHEN IT WITHDREW THE GRECO-PERSIAN WARS DREW TO A QUIET END. Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia, the so-called Peace of Callias .",True,True,2.040630124974996,True,1.2948989170254208

The assassination occurred five days after the commander of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia , General Robert E. Lee , surrendered to Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant and the Union Army of the Potomac . Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated, though an unsuccessful attempt had been made on Andrew Jackson 30 years before in 1835. The assassination was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth , as part of a larger conspiracy in a bid to revive the Confederate cause. Booth's co-conspirators were Lewis Powell and David Herold , who were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward , and George Atzerodt who was to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson . By simultaneously eliminating the top three people in the administration, Booth and his co-conspirators hoped to sever the continuity of the United States government. Lincoln was shot while watching the play Our American Cousin with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on the night of April 14, 1865. He died early the next morning.

1570,Q3032,what is wheat grain found in?,Wheat,"Wheat (Triticum spp.) is a cereal grain , originally from the Levant region of the Near East and Ethiopian Highlands , but now cultivated worldwide. In 2010, world production of wheat was 651 million tons, making it the third most-produced cereal after maize (844 million tons) and rice (672 million tons). Wheat was the second most-produced cereal in 2009; world production in that year was 682 million tons, after maize (817 million tons), and with rice as a close third (679 million tons). This grain is grown on more land area than any other commercial food. World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. Globally, wheat is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having a higher protein content than soybeans or the other major cereals, maize (corn) or rice. In terms of total production tonnages used for food, it is currently second to rice as the main human food crop and ahead of maize, after allowing for maize's more extensive use in animal feeds. Wheat was a key factor enabling the emergence of city-based societies at the start of civilization because it was one of the first crops that could be easily cultivated on a large scale, and had the additional advantage of yielding a harvest that provides long-term storage of food. Wheat contributed to the emergence of city-states in the Fertile Crescent , including the Babylonian and Assyrian empires. Wheat grain is a staple food used to make flour for leavened, flat and steamed breads , biscuits , cookies , cakes , breakfast cereal , pasta , noodles , couscous and for fermentation to make beer , other alcoholic beverages , or biofuel . Wheat is planted to a limited extent as a forage crop for livestock, and its straw can be used as a construction material for roofing thatch .

2116,Q998,What does Rapture meaning in a theological sense?,Rapture,"The Rapture is a term in Christian eschatology which refers to the ""being caught up"" discussed in 1 Thessalonians 4:17, when the ""dead in Christ"" and ""we who are alive and remain"" will be ""caught up in the clouds"" to meet ""the Lord in the air"". The term ""Rapture"" is used in at least two senses. In the pre-tribulation view, a group of people will be left behind on earth after another group literally leaves ""to meet the Lord in the air."" This is now the most common use of the term, especially among fundamentalist Christians and in the United States. The other, older use of the term ""Rapture"" is simply as a synonym for the final resurrection generally, without a belief that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17. This distinction is important as some types of Christianity never refer to ""the Rapture"" in religious education, but might use the older and more general sense of the word ""rapture"" in referring to what happens during the final resurrection. There are many views among Christians regarding the timing of Christ's return (including whether it will occur in one event or two), and various views regarding the destination of the aerial gathering described in 1 Thessalonians 4. Denominations such as Roman Catholics , Orthodox Christians , Lutheran Christians, and Reformed Christians believe in a rapture only in the sense of a general final resurrection, when Christ returns a single time. They do not believe that a group of people is left behind on earth for an extended Tribulation period after the events of 1 Thessalonians 4:17.

1941,Q77,how are the # of electrons in each shell determined,Electron shell,"Periodic table with electron shells An electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom 's nucleus . The closest shell to the nucleus is called the ""1 shell"" (also called ""K shell""), followed by the ""2 shell"" (or ""L shell""), then the ""3 shell"" (or ""M shell""), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shell letters K, L, M, ..., used in the X-ray notation , are alphabetical. Each shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons: The 1st shell can hold up to two electrons, the 2nd shell can hold up to eight electrons, the 3rd shell can hold up to 18, and 4th shell can hold up to 32 and so on. Since electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus, an atom's electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electrons. However, this is not a strict requirement: Atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shells. (See Madelung rule for more details.) For an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration . The electrons in the outermost occupied shell (or shells) determine the chemical properties of the atom; it is called the valence shell.

1945,Q774,what culture is mariah carey,Mariah Carey,"Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is an American singer , songwriter , record producer , actress , and philanthropist . Under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola , Carey released her self-titled debut studio album Mariah Carey in 1990; it went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993 and success with hit records Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993), and Merry Christmas (1994), Carey was established as Columbia's highest-selling act. Daydream (1995) made music history when its second single "" One Sweet Day "", a duet with Boyz II Men , spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and remains the longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history . During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her R&B and pop beginnings and slowly traversed into hip hop. This musical change became evident with the release of Butterfly (1997), at which time Carey had separated from Mottola. Carey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a record-breaking $100 million recording contract with Virgin Records . Before the release of her first feature film Glitter (2001), she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. Following the film's poor reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career. She signed a multi-million dollar contract deal with Island Records in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). Its second single "" We Belong Together "" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named ""Song of the Decade"" by Billboard . Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received starring role in (2009); she was awarded the ""Breakthrough Performance Award"" at the Palm Springs International Film Festival , and Black Reel and NAACP Image Award nominations. In a career spanning over two decades, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the World Music Awards . Carey was also named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. According to the Recording Industry Association of America , she is the third best-selling female artist in the United States, with 63.5 million certified albums. With the release of "" Touch My Body "" (2008), Carey gained her eighteenth number one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist. In 2012, Carey was ranked second on VH1 's list of the ""100 Greatest Women in Music"". Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won five Grammy Awards , 17 World Music Awards, 11 American Music Awards , and 31 Billboard Music Awards .

2077,Q950,what form of decay does not change the atomic number of them decaying atom?,Radioactive decay,"Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay, in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle , and thereby transforms (or 'decays') into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less. Many other types of decays are possible. Radioactive decay, also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity, is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting particles of ionizing radiation . A material that spontaneously emits this kind of radiation — which includes the emission of energetic alpha particles , beta particles , and gamma rays — is considered radioactive. There are many different types of radioactive decay (see table below). A decay, or loss of energy, results when an atom with one type of nucleus, called the parent radionuclide , transforms to an atom with a nucleus in a different state, or to a different nucleus containing different numbers of protons and neutrons . Either of these products is named the daughter nuclide. In some decays the parent and daughter are different chemical elements , and thus the decay process results in nuclear transmutation (creation of an atom of a new element). The first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay , beta decay , and gamma decay . Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle (helium nucleus). This is the most common process of emitting nucleons , but in rarer types of decays, nuclei can eject protons , or specific nuclei of other elements (in the process called cluster decay ). Beta decay occurs when the nucleus emits an electron or positron and a type of neutrino , in a process that changes a proton to a neutron or the other way around. The nucleus may capture an orbiting electron, converting a proton into a neutron ( electron capture ). All of these processes result in nuclear transmutation. By contrast, there exist radioactive decay processes that do not result in transmutation. The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in gamma decay, or used to eject an orbital electron by interaction with the excited nucleus in a process called internal conversion . Radioisotopes occasionally emit neutrons, and this results in a change in an element from one isotope to another. One type of radioactive decay results in products which are not defined, but appear in a range of ""pieces"" of the original nucleus. This decay is called spontaneous fission . This decay happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two (and occasionally three) smaller daughter nuclei, and usually emits gamma rays, neutrons, or other particles as a consequence. Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e., random) process at the level of single atoms, in that, according to quantum theory , it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay. However, the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over time. For a large number of atoms, the decay rate for the collection is computable from the measured decay constants of the nuclides (or equivalently from the half-lifes ).","Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay, in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle , and thereby transforms (or 'decays') into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 less.

1575,Q3037,What is an economic feature?,Economics,"Economics is the social science that analyzes the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services . The term economics comes from the Ancient Greek (', ""management of a household, administration"") from (', ""house"") + (', ""custom"" or ""law""), hence ""rules of the house(hold)"". Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested ""economics"" as a shorter term for ""economic science"" that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to "" mathematics "", ""ethics"", and so forth. A focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work. Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents (such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers) and markets, and their interactions. Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy. Other broad distinctions include those between positive economics (describing ""what is"") and normative economics (advocating ""what ought to be""); between economic theory and applied economics ; between rational and behavioral economics ; and between mainstream economics (more ""orthodox"" and dealing with the ""rationality-individualism-equilibrium nexus"") and heterodox economics (more ""radical"" and dealing with the ""institutions-history-social structure nexus""). Economic analysis may be applied throughout society, as in business , finance , health care , and government, but also to such diverse subjects as crime, education , the family , law , politics , religion , social institutions , war, and science . At the turn of the 21st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism . An increasing number of economists have called for increased emphasis on environmental sustainability; this area of research is known as Ecological economics .","Economics is the social science that analyzes the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services . The term economics comes from the Ancient Greek (', ""management of a household, administration"") from (', ""house"") + (', ""custom"" or ""law""), hence ""rules of the house(hold)"". Political economy was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested ""economics"" as a shorter term for ""economic science"" that also avoided a narrow political-interest connotation and as similar in form to "" mathematics "", ""ethics"", and so forth. A focus of the subject is how economic agents behave or interact and how economies work. Consistent with this, a primary textbook distinction is between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics examines the behavior of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents (such as households and firms or as buyers and sellers) and markets, and their interactions. Macroeconomics analyzes the entire economy and issues affecting it, including unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and monetary and fiscal policy. OTHER BROAD DISTINCTIONS INCLUDE THOSE BETWEEN POSITIVE ECONOMICS (DESCRIBING ""WHAT IS"") AND NORMATIVE ECONOMICS (ADVOCATING ""WHAT OUGHT TO BE""); BETWEEN ECONOMIC THEORY AND APPLIED ECONOMICS ; BETWEEN RATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS ; AND BETWEEN MAINSTREAM ECONOMICS (MORE ""ORTHODOX"" AND DEALING WITH THE ""RATIONALITY-INDIVIDUALISM-EQUILIBRIUM NEXUS"") AND HETERODOX ECONOMICS (MORE ""RADICAL"" AND DEALING WITH THE ""INSTITUTIONS-HISTORY-SOCIAL STRUCTURE NEXUS"").

423,Q1535,what where the most important factors that led to the defeat of the democrates in 1968?,"United States presidential election, 1968","The United States presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968. The Republican nominee, former Vice-President Richard Nixon , won the election over the Democratic nominee, incumbent Vice-President Hubert Humphrey . Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation's cities, torn by riots and crime. Analysts have argued the election of 1968 is a realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years. Coming four years after Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson won in a historic landslide, the election saw the incumbent president forced out of the race and a Republican elected for the first time in twelve years. It was a wrenching national experience, conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. , and subsequent race riots across the nation, the assasination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy , widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses, and violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic party split again and again. The election featured the strongest third party effort since 1912 by former Alabama Governor George Wallace , a Democrat. Because Wallace's campaign opposed federal intervention in the South to end school segregation , he carried the Deep South and ran well in ethnic industrial districts in the North. This was the last election in which New York had the most votes in the electoral college (43 votes). After the 1970 census , California gained the most electoral votes and has remained the most populous state since then. This is the latest election where a presidential ticket won without carrying the vice presidential candidate's home state.","The United States presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election , held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968.

274,Q135,how much does cloud 10 cost wikipedia,Cloud,"Stratocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus In meteorology , a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols . Clouds in Earth's atmosphere are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology . Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated; cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. In general, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga , which evaporates before reaching the surface. The international cloud classification system is based on the fact clouds in their most basic forms can show free-convective upward growth like cumulus , appear in non-convective layered sheets such as stratus , or take the form of thin fibrous wisps, as in the case of cirrus . Prefixes are used in connection with clouds to express variations or complexities in these basic forms or to specify middle or high altitude ranges. These include strato- for low clouds with limited convection that form mostly in uneven layers, cumulo- for complex highly-convective storm clouds, nimbo- for thick layered clouds of some complexity that can produce moderate to heavy precipitation, alto- for middle clouds, and cirro- for high clouds; the latter two of which may be of simple or moderately complex structure. Whether or not a cloud is low, middle, or high level depends on how far above the ground its base forms. Cloud types with significant vertical extent can form in the low or middle altitude ranges depending on the moisture content of the air. Clouds in the troposphere have Latin names due to the popular adaptation of Luke Howard 's cloud categorization system, which began to spread in popularity during December 1802. Synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds. While a majority of clouds form in Earth's troposphere, there are occasions when clouds in the stratosphere and mesosphere can be observed. These three main layers of the atmosphere where clouds may be seen are collectively known as the homosphere . Above this lies the thermosphere and exosphere , which together make up the heterosphere that marks the transition to outer space . Clouds have been observed on other planets and moons within the Solar System , but, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are composed of other substances such as methane , ammonia , and sulfuric acid .","Stratocumulus stratiformis cumulogenitus In meteorology , a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols . Clouds in Earth's atmosphere are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology . Two processes, possibly acting together, can lead to air becoming saturated; cooling the air or adding water vapor to the air. In general, precipitation will fall to the surface; an exception is virga , which evaporates before reaching the surface. The international cloud classification system is based on the fact clouds in their most basic forms can show free-convective upward growth like cumulus , appear in non-convective layered sheets such as stratus , or take the form of thin fibrous wisps, as in the case of cirrus . Prefixes are used in connection with clouds to express variations or complexities in these basic forms or to specify middle or high altitude ranges. These include strato- for low clouds with limited convection that form mostly in uneven layers, cumulo- for complex highly-convective storm clouds, nimbo- for thick layered clouds of some complexity that can produce moderate to heavy precipitation, alto- for middle clouds, and cirro- for high clouds; the latter two of which may be of simple or moderately complex structure. Whether or not a cloud is low, middle, or high level depends on how far above the ground its base forms. Cloud types with significant vertical extent can form in the low or middle altitude ranges depending on the moisture content of the air. Clouds in the troposphere have Latin names due to the popular adaptation of Luke Howard 's cloud categorization system, which began to spread in popularity during December 1802. Synoptic surface weather observations use code numbers to record and report the types of tropospheric cloud visible at each scheduled observation time based on the height and physical appearance of the clouds.

1145,Q2472,what is puerto rico currency,Currencies of Puerto Rico,"The currencies of Puerto Rico closely follow the historic development of Puerto Rico . As a colony of Spain and the United States , Puerto Rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies. Following the Spanish colonization in 1502, Puerto Rico became an important port, with its own supply of gold. However, as the mineral reserves ran empty within the century, the archipelago's economy suffered. The Spanish Crown issued the Situado Mexicano, which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the Viceroyalty of New Spain would be sent to the island, as a way to provide economic support. Between 1636 and 1637, Philip IV of Spain imposed a tax which had to be paid using a revenue stamp . Inspired by this, Puerto Rico began producing banknotes in 1766, becoming the first colony to print 8- real banknotes in the Spanish Empire and which in the Spanish government's approval of subsequent issues. The situado was discontinued during the 19th century, creating an economic crisis, as a result of Mexico gaining its independence from Spain. Salvador Meléndez Bruna , the colonial governor in office, ordered the issue of provincial banknotes, creating the Puerto Rican peso. However, printing of these banknotes ceased after 1815. During the following decades, foreign coins became the widespread currency. In the 1860s and 1870s, banknotes reemerged. On February 1, 1890, the Banco Español de Puerto Rico was inaugurated and began issuing banknotes. The bank designed four series and placed three in circulation under Spanish rule. In 1895, a Royal Decree ordered the production of provincial peso coins. On August 13, 1898, the Spanish-American War ended with Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States. The Banco Español de Puerto Rico was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills equivalent to the United States dollar , creating the Puerto Rican dollar. In 1902, the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner. Two more series were issued until 1913. After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury .

1088,Q2398,what is Polyester in packaging PET,Polyethylene terephthalate,"Polyethylene terephthalate (sometimes written poly(ethylene terephthalate)), commonly abbreviated PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P, is a thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in synthetic fibers ; beverage, food and other liquid containers ; thermoforming applications; and engineering resins often in combination with glass fiber. The term polyethylene terephthalate is a source of confusion because this substance, PET, does not contain polyethylene . Thus, the alternate form, poly(ethylene terephthalate), is often used in scholarly journals for the sake of accuracy and clarity. Depending on its processing and thermal history, polyethylene terephthalate may exist both as an amorphous (transparent) and as a semi-crystalline polymer . The semicrystalline material might appear transparent (particle size < 500 nm) or opaque and white (particle size up to a few microns) depending on its crystal structure and particle size. Its monomer (bis-β-hydroxyterephthalate) can be synthesized by the esterification reaction between terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol with water as a byproduct, or by transesterification reaction between ethylene glycol and dimethyl terephthalate with methanol as a byproduct. Polymerization is through a polycondensation reaction of the monomers (done immediately after esterification/transesterification) with water as the byproduct. The majority of the world's PET production is for synthetic fibers (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for around 30% of global demand. In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, "" polyester ,"" whereas the acronym ""PET"" is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the third-most-produced polymer; polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are first and second, respectively.

504,Q1639,what is adem disease,Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis,"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an immune mediated disease of the brain . It usually occurs following a viral infection but may appear following vaccination , bacterial or parasitic infection, or even appear spontaneously. As it involves autoimmune demyelination , it is similar to multiple sclerosis , and is considered part of the Multiple sclerosis borderline diseases. The incidence rate is about 8 per 1,000,000 people per year. Although it occurs in all ages, most reported cases are in children and adolescents , with the average age around 5 to 8 years old. The mortality rate may be as high as 5%, full recovery is seen in 50 to 75% of cases, while up to 70 to 90% recover with some minor residual disability.

Collectivism is a basic cultural element that exists as the reverse of individualism in human nature (in the same way high context culture exists as the reverse of low context culture ). Collectivist orientations stress the importance of cohesion within social groups (such as an ""in-group"", in what specific context it is defined) and in some cases, the priority of group goals over individual goals. Collectivists often focus on community, society, nation or country. It has been used as an element in many different and diverse types of government and political, economic and educational philosophies throughout history and most human societies in practice contain elements of both individualism and collectivism. Some examples of collectivist cultures include India and Japan. Collectivism can be divided into horizontal collectivism and vertical collectivism. Horizontal collectivism stresses collective decision-making among equal individuals, and is thus usually based on decentralization and egalitarianism. Vertical collectivism is based on hierarchical structures of power and on moral and cultural conformity, and is therefore based on centralization and hierarchy. A cooperative enterprise would be an example of horizontal collectivism, whereas a military hierarchy would be an example of vertical collectivism.","Collectivism is any philosophic, political, religious, economic, or social outlook that emphasizes the interdependence of every human being in a society or civilization .

Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane , but commonly including varying amounts of other hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide , nitrogen , and hydrogen sulfide . Natural gas is an energy source often used for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals . Natural gas is found in deep underground natural rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates . Petroleum is also another resource found in proximity to and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes , bogs , landfills , and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material. Before natural gas can be used as a fuel, it must undergo processing to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas. The by-products of processing include ethane , propane , butanes , pentanes , and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons , hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure sulfur ), carbon dioxide , water vapor , and sometimes helium and nitrogen . Natural gas is often informally referred to simply as gas, especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal.","Natural gas extraction by countries in cubic meters per year.

904,Q2160,what is the california sales taxes,Sales taxes in the United States,"Sales taxes in the United States are taxes placed on the sale or lease of goods and services in the United States . While no national general sales tax exists, the federal government levies several national selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods and services. Furthermore, forty-five states, the District of Columbia, and Guam impose general sales taxes that apply to the sale or lease of most goods and some services, and states also may levy selective sales taxes on the sale or lease of particular goods or services. States may also delegate to local governments the authority to impose additional general or selective sales taxes. Sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the applicable tax rate. Tax rates vary widely by jurisdiction and range from less than 1% to over 10%. Sales tax is collected by the seller at the time of sale. Use tax is self assessed by a buyer who has not paid sales tax on a taxable purchase. Unlike the value added tax , a sales tax is imposed only once, at the retail level. However, in cases where items are sold at retail more than once, such as used cars, the sales tax can be charged on the same item indefinitely. The definition of retail sales and what goods and services are taxable vary among the states. Nearly all jurisdictions provide numerous categories of goods and services that are exempt from sales tax, or taxed at reduced rates. The purchase of goods for further manufacture or for resale is uniformly exempt from sales tax. Most jurisdictions exempt food sold in grocery stores, prescription medications, and many agricultural supplies. Sales taxes, including those imposed by local governments, are generally administered at the state level. States imposing sales tax require retail sellers to collect tax from customers, file returns, and remit the tax to the state. Procedural rules vary widely. Sellers generally must collect tax from in-state purchasers unless the purchaser provides an exemption certificate.

The word ""slug"" is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell, has a very reduced shell, or has only a small internal shell. (This is in contrast to the common name "" snail "", which is applied to gastropods that have a coiled shell that is large enough that the soft parts of the animal can retract fully into it.) Slugs exist on land and in the sea, and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs, Acochlidium . The unadorned word ""slug"" is however applied primarily to land slugs, whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater are usually referred to as "" sea slugs "" and ""freshwater slugs"". Land gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial , but is too small to retract into (like many in the family Urocyclidae ), are known as semislugs . The various taxonomic families of slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages which also include snails. Thus, for example, the various families of land slugs are not very closely related to one another, despite a superficial similarity in the overall body form. The shell-less condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past, and thus the category ""slug"" is emphatically a polyphyletic one. Slugs, like all other gastropods, undergo torsion (a 180° twisting of the internal organs) during development. Internally, slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation, but externally the bodies of land slugs appear to be more or less symmetrical, except for the positioning of the pneumostome , which is on one side of the animal, normally the right hand side. The soft, slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation , so land-living slugs are confined to moist environments and must retreat to damp hiding places when the weather is dry.

145,Q1183,when did sertraline come on the market,Sertraline,"Sertraline hydrochloride (trade names Zoloft, Lustral) is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It was introduced to the market by Pfizer in 1991. Sertraline is primarily prescribed for major depressive disorder in adult outpatients as well as obsessive–compulsive , panic , and social anxiety disorders in both adults and children. In 2011, it was the second-most prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market, with 37,208,000 prescriptions. The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of older tricyclic antidepressants, but its side effects are much less pronounced. Differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and also mostly confined to side effects. Evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than fluoxetine (Prozac) for some subtypes of depression. Treatment of panic disorder with sertraline results in a significant decrease of the number of panic attacks and in improved quality of life. For obsessive-compulsive disorder, sertraline is not as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy ; the best results have been achieved by combining these two treatments. Although approved for social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder , sertraline leads to only modest improvement in these conditions. Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment. Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and sexual side effects; however, it does not cause weight gain, and its effects on both cognition and vigilance are relatively mild. In pregnant women taking sertraline, the drug was present in significant concentrations in fetal blood, and was also associated with a higher rate of various birth defects . Similarly to other antidepressants, the use of sertraline for depression may be associated with a higher rate of suicidality.","Sertraline hydrochloride (trade names Zoloft, Lustral) is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class.

785,Q2016,What is the first program to run during a system boot sequence?,Booting,"In computing , booting (also known as booting up) is the initial set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power to the CPU is switched on. The process begins when a computer is turned on for the first time or is re-energized after being turned off, and ends when the computer is ready to perform its normal operations. On modern general purpose computers, this can take tens of seconds and typically involves performing a power-on self-test , locating and initializing peripheral devices, and then finding, loading and starting an operating system . Many computer systems also allow these operations to be initiated by a software command without cycling power, in what is known as a soft reboot , though some of the initial operations might be skipped on a soft reboot. A boot loader is a computer program that loads the main operating system or runtime environment for the computer after completion of the self-tests. The computer term boot is short for bootstrap or bootstrap load and derives from the phrase to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps . The usage calls attention to the requirement that, if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer, some mechanism must exist to load initial software onto the computer. Early computers used a variety of ad-hoc methods to get a small program into memory to solve this problem. The invention of integrated circuit read-only memory (ROM) of various types solved this paradox by allowing computers to be shipped with a start up program that could not be erased. Growth in the capacity of ROM has allowed ever more elaborate start up procedures to be implemented. On general purpose computers, the boot process begins with the execution of an initial program stored in boot ROMs or read in another fashion. In some older computers, the initial program might have been the application to run, if no operating system was used, or the operating system. In other computers, the initial program is a boot loader that may then load into random-access memory (RAM), from nonvolatile secondary storage (such as a hard disk drive ) or, in some older computers, from a medium such as punched cards , punched tape , or magnetic tape in older computers, the binary code of an operating system or runtime environment and then execute it. If the boot loader is limited in its size and capabilities, it may, instead, load a larger and more capable secondary boot loader, which would then load the operating system or runtime environment. Some embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to begin functioning and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in ROM.","In computing , booting (also known as booting up) is the initial set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power to the CPU is switched on.

520,Q1666,what is a cervix childbirth,childbirth,"Childbirth, labour, delivery, birth, partus, or parturition is the culmination of a pregnancy period with the expulsion of one or more newborn infants from a woman 's uterus . The process of normal childbirth is categorized in three stages of labour: the shortening and dilation of the cervix , descent and birth of the infant , and birth of the placenta . In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through induction of labor or caesarean section , which is the removal of the neonate through a surgical incision in the abdomen , rather than through vaginal birth. Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the U.S. from 1996 to 2006, and comprise nearly 32% of births in the U.S. and Canada.

1439,Q2857,What is hydrogen in,Hydrogen,"Hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of ( for hydrogen-1 ), hydrogen is the lightest element and its monatomic form (H1) is the most abundant chemical substance, constituting roughly 75% of the Universe's baryonic mass. Non- remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state. At standard temperature and pressure , hydrogen is a colorless , odorless , tasteless , non-toxic, nonmetallic , highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Most of the hydrogen on Earth is in molecules such as water and organic compounds because hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry with many reactions exchanging protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds , it can take a negative charge (an anion known as a hydride and written as H−), or as a positively charged species H+. The latter cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds always occur as more complex species. The most common isotope of hydrogen is protium (name rarely used, symbol 1H) with a single proton and no neutrons . As the simplest atom known, the hydrogen atom has been of theoretical use. For example, as the only neutral atom with an analytic solution to the Schrödinger equation , the study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics . Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century, via the mixing of metals with acids. In 1766–81, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in Greek, hydrogen means ""water-former"". Industrial production is mainly from the steam reforming of natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive hydrogen production methods like the electrolysis of water . Most hydrogen is employed near its production site, with the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking ) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.","Hydrogen is a chemical element with symbol H and atomic number 1.

909,Q2165,what is lost purchasing power,Purchasing power,"Purchasing power (sometimes retroactively called adjusted for inflation) is the amount of goods or services that can be purchased with a unit of currency . For example, if you had taken one dollar to a store in the 1950s, you would have been able to buy a greater number of items than you would today, indicating that you would have had a greater purchasing power in the 1950s. Currency can be either a commodity money , like gold or silver , or fiat currency , or free-floating market-valued currency like US dollars . As Adam Smith noted, having money gives one the ability to ""command"" others' labor , so purchasing power to some extent is power over other people, to the extent that they are willing to trade their labor or goods for money or currency . If one's monetary income stays the same, but the price level increases, the purchasing power of that income falls. Inflation does not always imply falling purchasing power of one's money income since it may rise faster than the price level. A higher real income means a higher purchasing power since real income refers to the income adjusted for inflation. For a price index , its value in the base year is usually normalized to a value of 100. The purchasing power of a unit of currency, say a dollar, in a given year, expressed in dollars of the base year, is 100/P, where P is the price index in that year. So, by definition the purchasing power of a dollar decreases as the price level rises. The purchasing power in today's money of an amount C of money, t years into the future, can be computed with the formula for the present value : where in this case i is an assumed future annual inflation rate .","Purchasing power (sometimes retroactively called adjusted for inflation) is the amount of goods or services that can be purchased with a unit of currency .

626,Q180,what did benedict arnold die,Benedict arnold,"Benedict Arnold (June 14, 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War who originally fought for the American Continental Army but defected to the British Army . While a general on the American side, he obtained command of the fort at West Point, New York , and planned to surrender it to the British forces. After the plan was exposed in September 1780, he was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general. Born in Connecticut , Arnold was a merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. After joining the growing army outside Boston , he distinguished himself through acts of intelligence and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics despite losing the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776, the Battle of Ridgefield , Connecticut (after which he was promoted to major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix , and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that ended his combat career for several years. Despite Arnold's successes, he was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments. Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts and found he was indebted to Congress after spending much of his own money on the war effort. Frustrated and bitter, Arnold decided to change sides in 1779, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he was offered, continued to pursue and was awarded command of West Point . Arnold's scheme to surrender the fort to the British was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers that revealed the plot. Upon learning of André's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture , narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington , who had been alerted to the plot. Arnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army , an annual pension of £360 , and a lump sum of over £6,000. He led British forces on raids in Virginia , and against New London and Groton, Connecticut , before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown .

1520,Q2966,what was the date of pearl harbor,Attack on Pearl Harbor,"The attack on Pearl Harbor (called Hawaii Operation or Operation AI by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters (Operation Z in planning) and the Battle of Pearl Harbor) was a surprise military strike conducted by the Imperial Japanese Navy against the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii, on the morning of December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan). From the standpoint of the defenders, the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time . The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States. The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers . All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four being sunk. Two of these were later raised, and with the remaining four repaired, six battleships returned to service later in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer . 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,402 Americans were killed and 1,282 wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded. One Japanese sailor was captured. The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters . The following day (December 8), the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (for example the Neutrality Patrol ) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day. There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to proclaim December 7, 1941, "" a date which will live in infamy "".","THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR (CALLED HAWAII OPERATION OR OPERATION AI BY THE JAPANESE IMPERIAL GENERAL HEADQUARTERS (OPERATION Z IN PLANNING) AND THE BATTLE OF PEARL HARBOR) WAS A SURPRISE MILITARY STRIKE CONDUCTED BY THE IMPERIAL JAPANESE NAVY AGAINST THE UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE AT PEARL HARBOR , HAWAII, ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 7, 1941 (DECEMBER 8 IN JAPAN). From the standpoint of the defenders, the attack commenced at 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian Time . The attack was intended as a preventive action in order to keep the U.S. Pacific Fleet from interfering with military actions the Empire of Japan was planning in Southeast Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom , the Netherlands , and the United States. The base was attacked by 353 Japanese fighters, bombers and torpedo planes in two waves, launched from six aircraft carriers . All eight U.S. Navy battleships were damaged, with four being sunk. Two of these were later raised, and with the remaining four repaired, six battleships returned to service later in the war. The Japanese also sank or damaged three cruisers , three destroyers , an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer . 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed; 2,402 Americans were killed and 1,282 wounded. Important base installations such as the power station, shipyard, maintenance, and fuel and torpedo storage facilities, as well as the submarine piers and headquarters building (also home of the intelligence section ) were not attacked. Japanese losses were light: 29 aircraft and five midget submarines lost, and 65 servicemen killed or wounded. One Japanese sailor was captured. The attack came as a profound shock to the American people and led directly to the American entry into World War II in both the Pacific and European theaters . The following day (December 8), the United States declared war on Japan. Domestic support for non-interventionism , which had been strong, disappeared. Clandestine support of Britain (for example the Neutrality Patrol ) was replaced by active alliance. Subsequent operations by the U.S. prompted Germany and Italy to declare war on the U.S. on December 11, which was reciprocated by the U.S. the same day. There were numerous historical precedents for unannounced military action by Japan. However, the lack of any formal warning, particularly while negotiations were still apparently ongoing, led President Franklin D.

695,Q1893,when slavery abolished,Slavery in the United States,"Slavery in the United States existed from the early years of the colonial period; it was firmly established by the time the United States sought independence from Great Britain in 1776. However, by 1804, all states north of the Mason and Dixon Line had either abolished slavery outright or passed laws for the gradual abolition of slavery. In 1787 Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory . But slavery gained new life in the South with the cotton industry after 1800, and expanded into the Southwest. The nation was polarized into slave and free states along the Mason-Dixon Line , which separated Pennsylvania and Maryland. The United States and Great Britain both prohibited the international slave trade in 1808, but the domestic trade, with sales to the Deep South , expanded dramatically, and many captives were shipped by the coastwise slave trade . Before the 1840s, the South was vigorously defending slavery and its expansion into the territories. In the North some abolitionists denounced it as sinful, and numerous anti-slavery forces rejected it as detrimental to the rights of free men. After failed compromises and Abraham Lincoln 's election, in 1861 eleven slave states broke away to form the Confederate States of America , leading to the American Civil War . The federal government in 1862 made abolition of slavery a war goal. In January 1863 President Lincoln freed slaves in the Confederacy through the Emancipation Proclamation . After the war, the Thirteenth Amendment , effective December 1865, abolished slavery throughout the entire United States, including the Border states and the Indian territories. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, an estimated 12 million Africans were shipped as slaves to the Americas . See Slavery in the Americas . The great majority went to the sugar plantations of the West Indies or Brazil, where mortality was high. About 645,000 were brought to what is now the United States. By the 1860 United States Census , the slave population in the American South had grown to four million. Of all 1,515,605 families in the 15 slave states , nearly 400,000 held slaves (roughly one in four), amounting to 8% of all American families. While some slaves worked as house servants and urban artisans, the great majority worked on plantations or large farms, cultivating lucrative cash crops, such as rice, tobacco, sugar and, after 1800, chiefly cotton. By 1860 most slaves were held in the Deep South , where they served in work-gangs; two-thirds worked in cotton. In small operations, they worked with their owners. In large plantations they were directed by white paid overseers. Under the system that became chattel slavery (ownership of a human being, and of his/her descendants), a racial element was fundamental: slaves were blacks of African descent and owned, almost universally, by whites of European descent. In the 17th century, Virginia, followed by other southern colonies, enacted law that children of slave mothers were born into slavery. Slaves could gain freedom only by running away (which was difficult and illegal to do), or by manumission by owners, which was regulated by states, and became increasingly difficult or prohibited. In the earliest era of chattel slavery, the colonies also organized work by a system of bonded labor known as indentured servitude . This typically lasted for several years for both poor Europeans and Africans alike, to pay off the costs of transport to the colonies. They contracted for such arrangements because of poor economies in their home countries. Between 1680 and 1700, as fewer Europeans migrated to the colonies, planters began to import more Africans as slaves. Recognizing the importance of slavery, the House of Burgesses in Virginia enacted a new slave code in 1705; it combined a variety of legislation and added new provisions enforcing white supremacy in the law.","Slavery in the United States existed from the early years of the colonial period; it was firmly established by the time the United States sought independence from Great Britain in 1776.

1593,Q315,what crimes do not have digital evidence,Digital forensics,"Aerial photo of FLETC , where US digital forensics standards were developed in the 1980s and '90s Digital forensics (sometimes known as digital forensic science) is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime . The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data . With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early '80s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged. Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion ). The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches, relating to the type of digital devices involved; computer forensics, network forensics , forensic data analysis and mobile device forensics . The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence. As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent , identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents. Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.","Aerial photo of FLETC , where US digital forensics standards were developed in the 1980s and '90s Digital forensics (sometimes known as digital forensic science) is a branch of forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime .

Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil (as part of the electronic discovery process) courts. Forensics may also feature in the private sector; such as during internal corporate investigations or intrusion investigation (a specialist probe into the nature and extent of an unauthorized network intrusion ). The technical aspect of an investigation is divided into several sub-branches, relating to the type of digital devices involved; computer forensics, network forensics , forensic data analysis and mobile device forensics . The typical forensic process encompasses the seizure, forensic imaging (acquisition) and analysis of digital media and the production of a report into collected evidence. As well as identifying direct evidence of a crime, digital forensics can be used to attribute evidence to specific suspects, confirm alibis or statements, determine intent , identify sources (for example, in copyright cases), or authenticate documents. Investigations are much broader in scope than other areas of forensic analysis (where the usual aim is to provide answers to a series of simpler questions) often involving complex time-lines or hypotheses.",False,False,4.418849875044543,True,1.4344534589909017
1969,Q801,how many countries do not allow women to vote,Women's suffrage,"U.S. women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote, February 1913. Women's suffrage also known as woman suffrage is the right of women to vote and to run for office. Limited voting rights were gained by women in Sweden , Finland and some western U.S. states in the late 19th century. International organizations were formed to coordinate efforts, especially the International Council of Women (1888) and the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (1904). In 1893, New Zealand , then a self-governing British colony, granted adult women the right to vote and the self-governing British colony of South Australia did the same in 1895, but also permitted women to run for office. Australia federated in 1901, and women acquired the right to vote and stand in federal elections from 1902, though uneven restrictions on Aboriginal women voting in national elections were not completely removed until 1962. The first European country to introduce women's suffrage was the Grand Duchy of Finland , then part of the Russian Empire , which also produced the world's first female members of parliament in the 1907 parliamentary elections . Norway followed, granting full women's suffrage in 1913. In most Western countries, women's suffrage came after World I War I I , with some important late adopters being France in 1944 and Switzerland in 1971. Women's suffrage has generally been recognized after political campaigns to obtain it were waged. In many countries it was granted before universal suffrage . Women's suffrage is explicitly stated as a right under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women , adopted by the United Nations in 1979.","U.S. women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote, February 1913.

22,Q1022,Who discovered the sense of touch?,Somatosensory system,"Touch is a crucial means of receiving information. This photo shows tactile markings identifying stairs for visually impaired people. The somatosensory system is a diverse sensory system comprising the receptors and processing centres to produce the sensory modalities such as touch, temperature , proprioception (body position), and nociception (pain). The sensory receptors cover the skin and epithelia , skeletal muscles , bones and joints , internal organs , and the cardiovascular system . While touch is considered one of the five traditional senses , the impression of touch is formed from several modalities. In medicine, the colloquial term ""touch"" is usually replaced with ""somatic senses"" to better reflect the variety of mechanisms involved. Somatic senses are sometimes referred to as somesthetic senses, with the understanding that somesthesis includes touch, proprioception and (depending on usage) also haptic perception. The system reacts to diverse stimuli using different receptors: thermoreceptors , nociceptors , mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors . Transmission of information from the receptors passes via sensory nerves through tracts in the spinal cord and into the brain. Processing primarily occurs in the primary somatosensory area in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex . The cortical homunculus was devised by Wilder Penfield . At its simplest, the system works when activity in a sensory neuron is triggered by a specific stimulus such as heat; this signal eventually passes to an area in the brain uniquely attributed to that area on the body—this allows the processed stimulus to be felt at the correct location. The point-to-point mapping of the body surfaces in the brain is called a homunculus and is essential in the creation of a body image . This brain-surface (""cortical"") map is not immutable, however. Dramatic shifts can occur in response to stroke or injury.","Touch is a crucial means of receiving information. This photo shows tactile markings identifying stairs for visually impaired people.

1202,Q2543,what is vat tax?,Value added tax,"A value added tax (VAT) is a form of consumption tax . From the perspective of the buyer, it is a tax on the purchase price. From that of the seller, it is a tax only on the value added to a product, material, or service, from an accounting point of view, by this stage of its manufacture or distribution. The manufacturer remits to the government the difference between these two amounts, and retains the rest for themselves to offset the taxes they had previously paid on the inputs. The value added to a product by or with a business is the sale price charged to its customer, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs. A VAT is like a sales tax in that ultimately only the end consumer is taxed. It differs from the sales tax in that, with the latter, the tax is collected and remitted to the government only once, at the point of purchase by the end consumer. With the VAT, collections, remittances to the government, and credits for taxes already paid occur each time a business in the supply chain purchases products.","A VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) IS A FORM OF CONSUMPTION TAX .

446,Q1566,when did the us stop producing vacuum tubes,Vacuum tube,"Modern vacuum tubes, mostly miniature style In electronics , a vacuum tube, electron tube (in North America), thermionic valve, tube, or valve is a device controlling electric current through a vacuum in a sealed container. The container is often thin transparent glass in a roughly cylindrical shape. The simplest vacuum tube, the diode, is essentially an incandescent light bulb with an added electrode inside. When the bulb's filament is heated white-hot, electrons are ""boiled"" off its surface and into the vacuum inside the bulb. If the electrode -- called a ""plate"" or ""anode"" -- is made more positive than the hot filament, a direct current flows through the vacuum to the electrode (a demonstration of the Edison effect ). As the current only flows in one direction, it makes it possible to convert an alternating current applied to the filament to direct current . The introduction of a third electrode, a grid between the filament and the plate, yields another function. A voltage applied to the grid controls the current flowing from the filament to the plate. Thus, it allows the device to be used as an electronic amplifier. Vacuum tubes are thus used for rectification , amplification , switching , or similar processing or creation of electrical signals . The vast majority of modern day tubes consist of a sealed container with a vacuum inside, and essentially rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. Some exceptions to this are dealt with in the section about gas-filled tubes below. Vacuum tubes were critical to the development of electronic technology, which drove the expansion and commercialization of radio broadcasting, television, radar, sound reinforcement , sound recording and reproduction , large telephone networks, analog and digital computers, and industrial process control . Although some applications had counterparts using earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter or mechanical computers , it was the invention of the vacuum tube with three electrodes (called a triode ) and its capability of electronic amplification that made these technologies widespread and practical. In most applications, solid-state devices such as transistors and other semiconductor devices have replaced tubes. Solid-state devices last longer and are smaller, more efficient, more reliable, and cheaper than tubes. Tubes can be fragile, sometimes generate significant unwanted heat, and can take many seconds—many minutes in critical applications—after powering on to warm to a temperature where they perform within operational tolerance. However, tubes still find uses where solid-state devices have not been developed, are impractical, or where a tube has superior performance, as with some devices in professional audio and high-power radio transmitters. Tubes are still produced for such applications. Tubes are less likely than semiconductor devices to be destroyed by the electromagnetic pulse produced by nuclear explosions and geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares.","Modern vacuum tubes, mostly miniature style In electronics , a vacuum tube, electron tube (in North America), thermionic valve, tube, or valve is a device controlling electric current through a vacuum in a sealed container.

705,Q1907,what record company was john lennon with,John Lennon,"Lennon's signature John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English musician, singer and songwriter who rose to worldwide fame as a founder member of the Beatles , one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed acts in the history of popular music. With Paul McCartney , he formed one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century. Born and raised in Liverpool , as a teenager Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze ; his first band, the Quarrymen , evolved into the Beatles in 1960. As the group disintegrated towards the end of the decade, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine , and iconic songs such as "" Give Peace a Chance "" and "" Imagine "". After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to devote time to raising his infant son Sean , but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy . He was murdered three weeks after its release. Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism , he moved to New York City in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon 's administration to deport him, while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement .

With Paul McCartney , he formed one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century. Born and raised in Liverpool , as a teenager Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze ; his first band, the Quarrymen , evolved into the Beatles in 1960. As the group disintegrated towards the end of the decade, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced the critically acclaimed albums John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine , and iconic songs such as "" Give Peace a Chance "" and "" Imagine "". After his marriage to Yoko Ono in 1969, he changed his name to John Ono Lennon. Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to devote time to raising his infant son Sean , but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the new album Double Fantasy . He was murdered three weeks after its release. Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews. Controversial through his political and peace activism , he moved to New York City in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by Richard Nixon 's administration to deport him, while some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement .

1377,Q2774,WHAT IS THE SPEED CLASS FOR CAMERA,Secure Digital,"Secure Digital or (SD) is a non-volatile memory card format for use in portable devices, such as mobile phones , digital cameras , GPS navigation devices , and tablet computers . The Secure Digital standard is maintained by the SD Card Association (SDA). SD technologies have been implemented in more than 400 brands across dozens of product categories and more than 8,000 models. The Secure Digital format includes four card families available in three different form factors. The four families are the original Standard-Capacity (SDSC), the High-Capacity ( SDHC ), the eXtended-Capacity ( SDXC ), and the SDIO , which combines input/output functions with data storage. The three form factors are the original size, the ""mini"" size, and the ""micro"" size (see illustration). There are many combinations of form factors and device families. Electrically passive adapters allow the use of a smaller card in a host device built to hold a larger card. Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards, but this article explains several factors that can prevent the use of a newer SD card: A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle. A newer card may use a file system the host device cannot navigate. Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides. The organization of the card was changed starting with the SDHC family. Some vendors produced SDSC cards above 1 GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so. The SDA uses several trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and assure users of compatibility.","Secure Digital or (SD) is a non-volatile memory card format for use in portable devices, such as mobile phones , digital cameras , GPS navigation devices , and tablet computers .

1753,Q531,how many high schools are in the us,Education in the United States,"Education in the United States is mainly provided by the public sector , with control and funding coming from three levels: local , state , and federal , in that order. Child education is compulsory , and there are also a large number and wide variety of higher education institutions throughout the country that one can choose to attend, both publicly and privately administered. Public education is universally available. School curricula, funding, teaching, employment, and other policies are set through locally elected school boards with jurisdiction over school districts with many directives from state legislatures. School districts are usually separate from other local jurisdictions, with independent officials and budgets. Educational standards and standardized testing decisions are usually made by state governments. The ages for compulsory education vary by state. It begins from ages five to eight and ends from ages fourteen to eighteen. Compulsory education requirements can generally be satisfied by educating children in public schools , state-certified private schools , or an approved home school program. In most public and private schools, education is divided into three levels: elementary school , middle school (sometimes called junior high school), and high school (sometimes referred to as secondary education). In almost all schools at these levels, children are divided by age groups into grades , ranging from kindergarten (followed by first grade ) for the youngest children in elementary school, up to twelfth grade , the final year of high school . The exact age range of students in these grade levels varies slightly from area to area. Post-secondary education , better known as "" college "" in the United States, is generally governed separately from the elementary and high school system, and is described in a separate section below. Government supported, free public schools for all started being established after the revolution, and expanded in the 19th century, as the results of efforts of men like Horace Mann and Booker T. Washington . By 1870, all states had free elementary schools, albeit only in urban centers. As the 20th century drew nearer, states started passing laws to make schooling compulsory, and by 1910, 72 percent of children attended school. Private schools continued to spread during this time, as well as colleges and—in the rural centers— land grant colleges . The year of 1910 also saw the first true high schools. During the rest of the 20th century, educational efforts centered on reducing the inequality of the schooling system. The landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education made the desegregation of elementary and high schools a national priority, while the Pell Grant program helped poor minorities gain access to college. Special education was made into federal law in 1975. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 made standardized testing a requirement, and in 1983, a commission was established to evaluate their results and propose a course of action. The resulting No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 was controversial and its goals proved to be unrealistic. A commission established in 2006 evaluated higher education , but its recommendations have yet to be fully implemented.","Education in the United States is mainly provided by the public sector , with control and funding coming from three levels: local , state , and federal , in that order.

40,Q1041,when did talk radio begin in the U.S.?,Talk radio,"Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues. Most shows are regularly hosted by a single individual, and often feature interviews with a number of different guests. Talk radio typically includes an element of listener participation, usually by broadcasting live conversations between the host and listeners who ""call in"" (usually via telephone) to the show. Listener contributions are usually screened by a show's producer(s) in order to maximize audience interest and, in the case of commercial talk radio, attract advertisers. Generally, the shows are organized into segments, each separated by a pause for advertisements ; however, in public or non-commercial radio, music is sometimes played in place of commercials to separate the program segments. Variations of talk radio include conservative talk , hot talk , liberal talk and sports talk . While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts . Now, it is possible for an individual to use a variety of services to host an Internet-based talk-radio show without carriage by a traditional radio station. In addition TV programming from talk and news outlets such as BBC , CNN , Bloomberg and Fox are now often available expanding the world of talk radio further. Talk radio listening is now enjoyed not only on radios, but a wide variety of other devices and services including PCs using iTunes , station directories such as Tunein , show directory smartphones with apps such as Stitcher .","Talk radio is a radio format containing discussion about topical issues.

1745,Q52,how are business ethics different in Africa and United States,Business ethics,"Business ethics (also corporate ethics) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment. It applies to all aspects of business conduct and is relevant to the conduct of individuals and entire organizations. Business ethics has both normative and descriptive dimensions. As a corporate practice and a career specialization, the field is primarily normative. Academics attempting to understand business behavior employ descriptive methods. The range and quantity of business ethical issues reflects the interaction of profit-maximizing behavior with non-economic concerns. Interest in business ethics accelerated dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, both within major corporations and within academia. For example, today most major corporations promote their commitment to non-economic values under headings such as ethics codes and social responsibility charters. Adam Smith said, ""People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."" Governments use laws and regulations to point business behavior in what they perceive to be beneficial directions. Ethics implicitly regulates areas and details of behavior that lie beyond governmental control. The emergence of large corporations with limited relationships and sensitivity to the communities in which they operate accelerated the development of formal ethics regimes.","Business ethics (also corporate ethics) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment.

The beginning of the English Renaissance is often taken, as a convenience, to be 1485, when the Battle of Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses and inaugurated the Tudor Dynasty . Renaissance style and ideas, however, were slow in penetrating England, and the Elizabethan era in the second half of the 16th century is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance.",True,True,2.842358958965633,True,1.7479790829820558

1317,Q2696,what is the meaning of reimbursement,Deductible,"In an insurance policy, the deductible is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses. In general usage, the term deductible may be used to describe one of several types of clauses (see below) that are used by insurance companies as a threshold for policy payments. Deductibles are typically used to deter the large number of trivial claims that a consumer can be reasonably expected to bear the cost of. By restricting its coverage to events that are significant enough to incur large costs, the insurance firm expects to pay out slightly smaller amounts much less frequently, incurring much higher savings. As a result, insurance premiums are typically cheaper when they involve higher deductibles. Deductibles are normally provided as clauses in an insurance policy that dictate how much of an insurance-covered expense is borne by the policyholder. They are normally quoted as a fixed quantity and is a part of most policies covering losses to the policy holder. The insurer then becomes liable for claimable expenses that exceed this amount (subject to the maximum sum claimable indicated in the contract). Depending on the policy, the deductible may apply per covered incident, or per year. For policies where incidences are not easy to delimit (for example health insurance), the deductible is typically applied per year. Several deductibles can be set by the insurer based on the cause of the claim. For example, a single housing insurance policy may contain multiple deductible amounts for loss or damage arising from theft, fire, natural calamities, evacuation etc. There are also deductible reimbursement programs that reimburse a deductible in the event of an auto, home, boat/yacht or health insurance claim.","In an insurance policy, the deductible is the amount of expenses that must be paid out of pocket before an insurer will pay any expenses.

1334,Q2717,what is pci Interface,Conventional PCI,"Conventional PCI (PCI is an initialism formed from Peripheral Component Interconnect, part of the PCI Local Bus standard and often shortened to just PCI) is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer . The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus , but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processor. Devices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus, and are assigned addresses in the processor's address space. Attached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself, called a planar device in the PCI specification, or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles , where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. PCI and PCI-X are being replaced by PCI Express , but , most motherboards are still made with one or more PCI slots, which are sufficient for many uses. The PCI specification covers the physical size of the bus (including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts), electrical characteristics, bus timing, and protocols. The specification can be purchased from the PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG). Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards , sound cards , modems , extra ports such as USB or serial , TV tuner cards and disk controllers . PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards, until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI; the preferred interface for video cards became AGP , and then PCI Express.

The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia , both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuq Turks . The main Western Christian source, Odo of Deuil , and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and, in 1148, participated in an ill-advised attack on Damascus . The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the Muslims . It would ultimately have a key influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century. The only success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the Holy Land , the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon , expelling its Moorish occupants.","The Second Crusade (1145–1149) was the second major crusade launched from Europe.

1827,Q623,What did the Supreme Court determine in Dred Scott v. Sandford?,Dred Scott v. Sandford,"Dred Scott v. Sandford, , also known as the Dred Scott Decision, was a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court . It made two main rulings. The first ruling was that African-Americans were not citizens, and therefore had no standing to sue in federal court. The second ruling was that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in any territory acquired subsequent to the creation of the United States. Given the first ruling, most scholars and many contemporary political figures (including the leadership of the then-new Republican Party) considered that the second ruling was not binding precedent, but mere dictum . The rationale of the Supreme Court regarding the jurisdictional ruling implied that people of African descent (both slave and free) were not protected by the Constitution and were not U.S. citizens . Since passage of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , both rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedent. Nonetheless, the case retains historical significance as it is widely regarded as the worst decision ever made by the Supreme Court. The opinion of the court, written by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney , stirred debate. The decision was 7–2, and every Justice besides Taney wrote a separate concurrence or dissent. For the first time since Marbury v. Madison , the Court held an Act of Congress to be unconstitutional. Dred Scott , an African-American slave, had asked a United States Circuit Court to award him his freedom because he and his master had resided in a state ( Illinois ) and a territory ( Wisconsin Territory ) where slavery had been banned. Chief Justice Roger Taney , writing for the court, held that Scott, as a person of African ancestry, was not a citizen of the United States and therefore had no right to sue in federal court. This holding was contrary to the practice of numerous states at the time, particularly Free states , where free blacks did in fact enjoy the rights of citizens, such as the right to vote and hold public office. In what is sometimes considered mere obiter dictum , the Court went on to hold that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories because slaves are personal property and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protects property owners against deprivation of their property without due process of law . In reaching this decision, Taney had hoped to settle the growing controversy surrounding slavery in the United States, but it had the opposite effect. The decision was fiercely debated across the country, as perhaps best exemplified by the Lincoln–Douglas debates of 1858. Abraham Lincoln , the second-ever Republican nominee for President, was able to win the presidential election in 1860 ; the stopping of the further expansion of slavery was a key Republican party plank. The decision played an important role in the timing of state secession and the Civil War, although it is extreme to say the decision ""caused"" the war. The decision is acknowledged for the influential role it played in altering the national political landscape: it is credited with launching Abraham Lincoln’s national political career and ultimately allowing for his election. Although the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case, the Court stated in the Slaughter-House Cases that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which begins by stating, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" To which the Court noted: The first observation we have to make on this clause is, that it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of differences of opinion. It declares that persons may be citizens of the United States without regard to their citizenship of a particular State, and it overturns the Dred Scott decision by making all persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the United States.","Dred Scott v.

246,Q1313,where does the return address go on mail,Return address,"In postal mail , a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the person sending the message. It provides the recipient (and sometimes authorized intermediaries) with a means to determine how to respond to the sender of the message if needed. The return address need not include a sender's name, but should include address or P.O. box details in the same way as the delivery address should. In some countries, the return address is conventionally located in the upper left hand corner of the envelope , card, or label. In the United Kingdom , the return address is usually placed on the reverse of the envelope, near the top. Businesses often use envelopes preprinted with a return address. Many individuals have sheets of adhesive labels preprinted with their home address to affix to their correspondence. Charities sometimes include such sheets in mailshots. Rolls of Return Address Labels can be purchased from companies that sell personalized labels to provide individuals an easy way to peel and stick return address labels to their envelopes. The return address is not required on postal mail. However, lack of a return address prevents the postal service from being able to return the item if it proves undeliverable; such as from damage, postage due , or invalid destination. Such mail may thus become dead letter mail . Should the return address be of a different state or country, the mail may be routed through that location for ease of return.","In postal mail , a return address is an explicit inclusion of the address of the person sending the message.

667,Q1851,what are stocks and bonds,Bond (finance),"In finance , a bond is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders. It is a debt security , under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon ) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity . Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, i.e. the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. Thus a bond is a form of loan or IOU : the holder of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer of the bond is the borrower (debtor), and the coupon is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments , or, in the case of government bonds , to finance current expenditure. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument. Bonds and stocks are both securities , but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in the company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (i.e. they are lenders). Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks may be outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, such as Consols , which is a perpetuity , i.e. a bond with no maturity.","IN FINANCE , A BOND IS AN INSTRUMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS OF THE BOND ISSUER TO THE HOLDERS. It is a debt security , under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and, depending on the terms of the bond, is obliged to pay them interest (the coupon ) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the maturity . Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, i.e. the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. Thus a bond is a form of loan or IOU : the holder of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer of the bond is the borrower (debtor), and the coupon is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments , or, in the case of government bonds , to finance current expenditure. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short term commercial paper are considered to be money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument. BONDS AND STOCKS ARE BOTH SECURITIES , BUT THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT (CAPITAL) STOCKHOLDERS HAVE AN EQUITY STAKE IN THE COMPANY (I.E. THEY ARE OWNERS), WHEREAS BONDHOLDERS HAVE A CREDITOR STAKE IN THE COMPANY (I.E. THEY ARE LENDERS).

Held each April, the Women's Championship was inaugurated in the 1981–82 season. The NCAA tournament was preceded by the AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament , which was held annually from 1972 to 1982. Basketball was one of twelve women's sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981-82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women for sole governance of women's collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports; however, after a year of dual women's championships, the NCAA prevailed, while the AIAW disbanded. Attendance and interest in the Women's Division I Championship have grown over the years, especially since 2003, when the final championship game was moved to the Tuesday following the Monday men's championship game. The women's championship game is now the final overall game of the college basketball season. Before that, the Women's Final Four was usually played on the Friday before the Men's Final Four or the hours before the men played on the final Saturday of the tournament. The final was usually played the Sunday afternoon following the Men's Final Four. The tournament bracket is made up of champions from each Division I conference, which receive automatic bids . The remaining slots are at-large bids , with teams chosen by an NCAA selection committee. The selection process and tournament seedings are based on several factors, including team rankings, win-loss records and Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) data.

Memorial Day is a day of remembering the men and women who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces . Formerly known as Decoration Day, it originated after the American Civil War to commemorate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War. By the 20th century Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who have died in all wars. It typically marks the start of the summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end. Many people visit cemeteries and memorials, particularly to honor those who have died in military service. Many volunteers place an American flag on each grave in national cemeteries . By the early 20th century, Memorial Day was an occasion for more general expressions of memory, as people visited the graves of their deceased relatives in church cemeteries, whether they had served in the military or not. It also became a long weekend increasingly devoted to shopping, family gatherings, fireworks, trips to the beach, and national media events. Annual Decoration Days for particular cemeteries are held on a Sunday in late spring or early summer in some rural areas of the American South, notably in the mountains. In cases involving a family graveyard where remote ancestors as well as those who were deceased more recently are buried, this may take on the character of an extended family reunion to which some people travel hundreds of miles.

1737,Q51,how did bleeding sumner lead to the civil war,Charles Sumner,"{{Infobox Senator The Dominican Republic annexation treaty caused bitter contention between President Grant and Sen. Sumner. Brady 1869]] Sen. Sumner, opposed to American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that annexation would lead to the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti, became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty, and that men close to the president shared in the corruption. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870. Sen. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State, Bancroft Davis , that U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect President Báez. Sen. Sumner's committee voted against annexation and at Sen. Sumner’s suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment, the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session. President Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14, 1870, and May 31, 1870. In closed session, Sen. Sumner spoke out against the treaty; warnng that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island, and the risk that the independence of Haiti, recognized by the United States in 1862, would be lost. Sumner stated that Grant's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional. Finally, on June 30, 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage. The following day, President Grant, feeling betrayed by Sen. Sumner, retaliated by ordering the dismissal of Sumner’s close friend J. Lothrop Motley , Ambassador to Britain. By autumn, Sumner's personal hostility to the president was public knowledge, and he blamed the Secretary of State for failing to have resigned, rather than let Grant have his way. The two men, friends until then, cooled into bitter enemies. In December, 1870, still fearful that Grant meant to acquire Santo Domingo somehow, Sumner gave a fiercely critical speech accusing the president of usurpation and Babcock of unethical conduct. Already, President Grant, supported by his Secretary of State Hamilton Fish , had initiated a campaign to depose Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although Sumner stated he was an ""Administration man"", in addition to having stopped Grant's Dominican Republic treaty attempt, Sumner had defeated Grant's full repeal of the Tenure of Office Act , blocked Grant's nomination of Alexander Stewart to U.S. Secretary of Treasury, and been a constant harassing force pushing Reconstruction policies faster than Grant had been willing to go. Grant resented Sumner's superiority of manner, as well. Told once that Sumner did not believe in the Bible, the president is supposed to have said that he was not surprised: ""he didn't write it."" As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased, Sumner’s health began to decline. When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, Senators affiliated with President Grant, known as ‘’New Radicals’’ voted to oust Sen.

782,Q2012,what is middle class in the us,American middle class,"The American middle class is a social class in the United States . While the concept is typically ambiguous in popular opinion and common language use, contemporary social scientists have put forward several, more or less congruent, theories on the American middle class. Depending on class model used, the middle class may constitute anywhere from 25% to 66% of households. One of the first major studies of the middle class in America was White Collar: The American Middle Classes , published in 1951 by sociologist C. Wright Wright_Mills Mills Wright_Mills . Later sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert of Hamilton College commonly divide the middle class into two sub-groups. Constituting roughly 15% to 20% of households is the upper or professional middle class consisting of highly educated, salaried professionals and managers. Constituting roughly one third of households is the lower middle class consisting mostly of semi-professionals, skilled craftsmen and lower-level management. Middle-class persons commonly have a comfortable standard of living, significant economic security, considerable work autonomy and rely on their expertise to sustain themselves. Members of the middle class belong to diverse groups which overlap with each other. Overall, middle-class persons, especially upper-middle-class individuals, are characterized by conceptualizing, creating and consulting. Thus, college education is one of the main indicators of middle-class status. Largely attributed to the nature of middle-class occupations, middle class values tend to emphasize independence, adherence to intrinsic standards, valuing innovation and respecting non-conformity . Politically more active than other demographics, college educated middle class professionals are split between the two major parties. Income varies considerably from near the national median to well in excess of $100,000. Household income figures, however, do not always reflect class status and standard of living , as they are largely influenced by the number of income earners and fail to recognize household size. It is therefore possible for a large, dual-earner, lower middle class household to out-earn a small, one-earner, upper middle class household. The middle classes are very influential, as they encompass the majority of voters, writers, teachers, journalists, and editors. Most societal trends in the US originate within the middle classes.","THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS IS A SOCIAL CLASS IN THE UNITED STATES .

The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries rich and poor . Personal income , tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25%, and in some countries rose as high as 33%. Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry . Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as cash cropping , mining and logging suffered the most.

It was the longest, most widespread, and deepest depression of the 20th century. In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world's economy can decline. The depression originated in the U.S., after the fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday ). The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries rich and poor . Personal income , tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25%, and in some countries rose as high as 33%. Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry . Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by approximately 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as cash cropping , mining and logging suffered the most. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. In many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the end of World War II.",False,False,5.428006458969321,True,1.9166145829949528

More explicitly, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defines a dwarf planet as a celestial body in direct orbit of the Sun that is massive enough for its shape to be controlled by gravitation , but that unlike a planet has not cleared its orbital region of other objects. The term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the Sun, brought about by an increase in discoveries of trans-Neptunian objects that rivaled Pluto in size, and finally precipitated by the discovery of an even more massive object, Eris . This classification states that bodies large enough to have cleared the neighbourhood of their orbit are defined as planets , while those that are not massive enough to be rounded by their own gravity are defined as small Solar System bodies . Dwarf planets come in between. The exclusion of dwarf planets from the roster of planets by the IAU has been both praised and criticized; it was said to be the ""right decision"" by Mike Brown , who discovered and other new dwarf planets, but has been rejected by Alan Stern , who had coined the term dwarf planet in 1990. The IAU currently recognizes five dwarf planets in the Solar System: , Pluto , , , and . However, only two of these bodies, Ceres and Pluto, have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they fit the definition. Eris has been accepted as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto. The IAU subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 (and hence a diameter of ≥838 km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1) are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets. The only two such objects known at the time, Makemake and Haumea, went through this naming procedure and were declared to be dwarf planets. It is suspected that another hundred or so known objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets. Estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets may be found when the entire region known as the Kuiper belt is explored, and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects scattered outside the Kuiper belt are considered.

The power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine , or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motors. Widespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy . Hydrogen fuel does not occur naturally on Earth and thus is not an energy source; rather it is an energy carrier. It is most frequently made from methane or other fossil fuels , but it can be produced using sources (such as wind, solar, or nuclear) that are intermittent, too diffuse or too cumbersome to directly propel vehicles. Integrated wind-to-hydrogen plants, using electrolysis of water , are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough, and quantities great enough, to compete with traditional energy sources. Many companies are working to develop technologies that might efficiently exploit the potential of hydrogen energy for mobile uses. The attraction of using hydrogen as an energy currency is that, if hydrogen is prepared without using fossil fuel inputs, vehicle propulsion would not contribute to carbon dioxide emissions. The drawbacks of hydrogen use are high capital cost, low energy content per unit volume, high tankage weights, very high storage vessel pressures, the storage, transportation and filling of gaseous or liquid hydrogen in vehicles, the large investment in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles, and the inefficiency of production processes.","Honda FCX Clarity , a hydrogen fuel cell demonstration vehicle introduced in 2008 A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive power.

The Republican nominee, former Vice-President Richard Nixon , won the election over the Democratic nominee, incumbent Vice-President Hubert Humphrey . Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation's cities, torn by riots and crime. Analysts have argued the election of 1968 is a realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years. Coming four years after Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson won in a historic landslide, the election saw the incumbent president forced out of the race and a Republican elected for the first time in twelve years. It was a wrenching national experience, conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. , and subsequent race riots across the nation, the assasination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F.

The Republican nominee, former Vice-President Richard Nixon , won the election over the Democratic nominee, incumbent Vice-President Hubert Humphrey . Nixon ran on a campaign that promised to restore law and order to the nation's cities, torn by riots and crime.

730,Q1943,what is a sacrifice in baseball,Sacrifice fly,"In baseball , a sacrifice fly is a batted ball that satisfies four criteria: There are fewer than two outs when the ball is hit. The ball is hit to the outfield (fair or foul), or to infield foul territory . The batter is put out because an outfielder (or an infielder running in the outfield, or foul territory) catches the ball on the fly (alternatively if the batter would have been out if not for an error or if the outfielder drops the ball and another runner is put out). A runner who is already on base scores on the play. It is called a ""sacrifice"" fly because the batter presumably intends to cause a teammate to score a run, while sacrificing his own ability to do so.","In baseball , a sacrifice fly is a batted ball that satisfies four criteria: There are fewer than two outs when the ball is hit.

Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. representative and senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961. Nixon was born in Yorba Linda , California. He graduated from Whittier College in 1934 and Duke University School of Law in 1937, returning to California to practice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon , moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942. He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II . Nixon was elected in California to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950 . His pursuit of the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist , and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election . Nixon served for eight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960 , narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy , and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962 . In 1968, he ran again for the presidency and was elected . Although Nixon initially escalated America's involvement in the Vietnam War , he subsequently ended U.S. involvement in 1973. Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened diplomatic relations between the two nations, and he initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. Domestically, his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states. Among other things, he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs , imposed wage and price controls, enforced desegregation of some Southern schools, and established the Environmental Protection Agency . Though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with Apollo 11 , he scaled back manned space exploration. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972.

1170,Q2503,where is marijuana legal,Legality of cannabis,"The legality of cannabis varies from country to country. Possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s. However, many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis, particularly in North America , South America and Europe . Furthermore, possession is legal or effectively legal in the Netherlands , North Korea and would be in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington if it were not for federal law, which governs persons in all states. The medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries, including Canada , the Czech Republic and Israel . While federal law in the United States bans all sale and possession of cannabis, enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law; two states ( Colorado and Washington ) have repealed their laws prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis and replaced them with a regulatory regime, also contrary to federal statute. Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but, apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana, most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe. Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation, use, possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use. A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis, making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment . Some jurisdictions/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users, with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes. There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in Canada . Drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs. However, simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries, particularly in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution.","The legality of cannabis varies from country to country.

1821,Q618,how does an earthworm eat & digests food.,Digestion,"Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller components that are more easily absorbed into a blood stream , for instance. Digestion is a form of catabolism : a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller ones. When food enters the mouth, digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication , a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva . Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus . It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis . Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion . Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin . As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. After some time (typically an hour or two in humans, 4–6 hours in dogs, somewhat shorter duration in house cats), the resulting thick liquid is called chyme . When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas , and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon.

181,Q1239,what the multiple endings of john say about its possible authorship;,Gospel of john,"The Gospel According to John ( Greek τὸ κατὰ Ἰωάννην εὐαγγέλιον), commonly referred to as the Gospel of John or simply John and often referred to in New Testament scholarship as the Fourth Gospel, is an account of the public ministry of Jesus . It begins with the witness and affirmation by John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection , and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. This account is fourth of the canonical gospels , after the synoptics Matthew , Mark and Luke . states that the book derives from the testimony of the ' disciple whom Jesus loved .' Along with Peter, the unnamed disciple is especially close to Jesus, and early-church tradition identified him as John the Apostle , one of Jesus' Twelve Apostles . The gospel is closely related in style and content to the three surviving Epistles of John such that commentators treat the four books together, yet, according to most modern scholars, John was not the author of any of these books. Recent Christian Scripture scholarship more and more has placed John within a first-century Jewish context. Raymond E. Brown did pioneering work to trace the development of the tradition from which the gospel arose. The discourses seem to be concerned with the actual issues of the church-and-synagogue debate at the time when the Gospel was written. It is notable that, in the gospel, the community still appears to define itself primarily against Judaism, rather than as part of a wider Christian church. Though Christianity started as a movement within Judaism, gradually Christians and Jews became bitterly opposed . John presents a ""higher"" Christology than the synoptics , meaning that it describes Jesus as the incarnation of the divine Logos through whom all things were made, as the object of veneration, and more explicitly as God incarnate . Only in John does Jesus talk at length about himself and his divine role, often shared with the disciples only. Against the synoptics, John focuses largely on different miracles (including resurrecting Lazarus ), given as signs meant to engender faith. Synoptic elements such as parables and exorcisms are not found in John. It presents a realized eschatology in which salvation is already present for the believer.","The Gospel According to John ( Greek τὸ κατὰ Ἰωάννην εὐαγγέλιον), commonly referred to as the Gospel of John or simply John and often referred to in New Testament scholarship as the Fourth Gospel, is an account of the public ministry of Jesus .

448,Q1568,where did winston churchill go to school,Winston Churchill,"Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955. Widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century, Churchill was also an officer in the British Army , a historian, a writer, and an artist. He is the only British Prime Minister in history to have received the Nobel Prize in Literature , and was also the first person to be made an Honorary Citizen of the United States . Churchill was born into an aristocratic family as the grandson of the 7th Duke of Marlborough . His father, Lord Randolph Churchill , was a charismatic politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer ; his mother, Jennie Jerome , was an American socialite. As a young army officer, he saw action in British India , The Sudan , and the Second Boer War . He gained fame as a war correspondent and wrote books about his campaigns. At the forefront of politics for fifty years, he held many political and cabinet positions. Before the First World War, he served as President of the Board of Trade , Home Secretary , and First Lord of the Admiralty as part of the Asquith Liberal government . During the war, he continued as First Lord of the Admiralty until the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign caused his departure from government. He then briefly resumed active army service on the Western Front as commander of the 6th Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers . He returned to government as Minister of Munitions , Secretary of State for War , and Secretary of State for Air . After the War, Churchill served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Conservative ( Baldwin ) government of 1924–29, controversially returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure on the UK economy. Also controversial was his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII . Out of office and politically ""in the wilderness"" during the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on 10 May 1940, Churchill became Prime Minister. His steadfast refusal to consider defeat, surrender, or a compromise peace helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult early days of the War when Britain stood alone among European countries in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler . Churchill was particularly noted for his speeches and radio broadcasts, which helped inspire the British people. He led Britain as Prime Minister until victory over Nazi Germany had been secured. After the Conservative Party lost the 1945 election, he became Leader of the Opposition to the Labour ( Attlee ) government. After winning the 1951 election, he again became Prime Minister, before retiring in 1955. Upon his death, Elizabeth II granted him the honour of a state funeral , which saw one of the largest assemblies of world statesmen in history. Named the Greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll, Churchill is widely regarded as being among the most influential people in British history.","Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill, (30 November 1874 – 24 January 1965) was a British politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and again from 1951 to 1955.

In some individuals (an estimated 20–30% of the general population) the arch simply never develops in one foot (unilaterally) or both feet (bilaterally). Three studies (see citations below in military section) of military recruits have shown no evidence of later increased injury, or foot problems, due to flat feet, in a population of people who reach military service age without prior foot problems. However, these studies cannot be used to judge possible future damage from this condition when diagnosed at younger ages.
