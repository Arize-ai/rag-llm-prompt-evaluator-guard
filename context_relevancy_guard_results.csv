968,Q2246,what is lean manufacturing and who developed,Lean manufacturing,"Lean manufacturing, lean enterprise, or lean production, often simply, ""Lean,"" is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, ""value"" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Essentially, lean is centered on preserving value with less work. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as ""Lean"" only in the 1990s. TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of Toyota , from a small company to the world's largest automaker, has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.","LEAN MANUFACTURING, LEAN ENTERPRISE, OR LEAN PRODUCTION, OFTEN SIMPLY, ""LEAN,"" IS A PRODUCTION PRACTICE THAT CONSIDERS THE EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES FOR ANY GOAL OTHER THAN THE CREATION OF VALUE FOR THE END CUSTOMER TO BE WASTEFUL, AND THUS A TARGET FOR ELIMINATION.

1224,Q2572,what is rationalism by john locke george berkeley,George Berkeley,"George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers , and as a result cannot exist without being perceived. Thus, as Berkeley famously put it, for physical objects ""esse est percipi"" ("" to be is to be perceived ""). Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction , an important premise in his argument for immaterialism. In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, , in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour. This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge in 1710 which, after its poor reception, he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous in 1713. In this book, Berkeley's views were represented by Philonous (Greek: 'lover of mind'), while Hylas (Greek: 'matter') embodies the Irish thinker’s opponents, in particular John Locke . Berkeley argued against Sir Isaac Newton 's doctrine of absolute space , time and motion in De Motu (on Motion), published 1721. His arguments were a precursor to the views of Mach and Einstein . In 1732, he published Alciphron , a Christian apologetic against the free-thinkers , and in 1734, he published The Analyst , an empiricist critique of the foundations of infinitesimal calculus , which was influential in the development of mathematics. His last major philosophical work, Siris (1744), begins by advocating the medicinal use of tar water , and then continues to discuss a wide range of topics including science, philosophy, and theology. Interest in Berkeley's work increased after World War II, because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.","George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others).

1721,Q488,how many died in hiroshima and nagasaki,Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were conducted by the United States during the final stages of World War II in 1945. The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. Following a firebombing campaign that destroyed many Japanese cities, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of Japan . The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on 8 May, but the Pacific War continued. Together with the United Kingdom and the Republic of China , the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, threatening Japan with ""prompt and utter destruction"". The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum, and the United States deployed two nuclear weapons developed by the Manhattan Project . American airmen dropped Little Boy on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, followed by Fat Man over Nagasaki on 9 August. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day. The Hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that, of the people who died on the day of the explosion, 60% died from flash or flame burns, 30% from falling debris and 10% from other causes. During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness , and other injuries, compounded by illness. In a US estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death, 15–20% died from radiation sickness, 20–30% from burns, and 50–60% from other injuries, compounded by illness. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison. On 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies, signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September, officially ending World War II. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan 's adopting Three Non-Nuclear Principles , forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.

252,Q1321,what state was the civil war in,American Civil War,"The American Civil War (ACW), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War (see naming ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States (the ""Union"" or the ""North"") and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""Confederacy"" or the ""South""). The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. Foreign powers did not intervene. After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began. In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States' territories . Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on "" King Cotton "" that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America. Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Robert E. Lee's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg . Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864. In the Western Theater, William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way. The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital. The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars . Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I . It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.

The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system . Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia . Hyperthermia can also be deliberately induced using drugs or medical devices and may be used in the treatment of some kinds of cancer and other conditions, most commonly in conjunction with radiotherapy . Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains unchanged.

As granted by the Constitution ( Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 ), Presidents have the power to grant clemency in one or more of the following ways: the ability to grant a full pardon , to commute a sentence, or to rescind a fine. U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law. As to the difference between a pardon and a commutation: A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction. A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself. Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone. The records of acts of clemency were public until 1934.

U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law. As to the difference between a pardon and a commutation: A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction. A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself. Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone. The records of acts of clemency were public until 1934. In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President H. W. Bush forward are now listed.

841,Q2084,what was john adams doing to help france,John Adams,"John Adams (October 30, 1735 ( O.S. October 19, 1735) – July 4, 1826) was the second president of the United States (1797–1801), having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States . An American Founding Father , he was a statesman, diplomat, and a leading advocate of American independence from Great Britain . Well educated, he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas, both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers . Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution . A lawyer and public figure in Boston , as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , he played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence. He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and was its primary advocate in the Congress. Later, as a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers. A political theorist and historian, Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government , influenced American political thought. One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character: in 1775, he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States . Adams' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president. During his one term, he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian Republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton . Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war (called the "" Quasi-War "") with France , 1798–1800. The major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton's opposition. In 1800, Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts. He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson. He and his wife, Abigail Adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family . Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams , the sixth President of the United States.

670,Q1855,what states has the electric chair,Electric chair,"Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. This execution method was created by employees of Thomas Edison during the War of Currents , and has been used only in the United States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines (its first use there in 1924 under American occupation , last in 1976). Historically, once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles (differing in voltage and duration) of alternating current would be passed through the individual's body, in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs (including the brain). The first jolt of electric current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs. Death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart . Although in the United States the electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution. Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution, today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner. As of 2010, electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method. In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 (Kentucky: March 31, 1998; Tennessee: December 31, 1998) and who chose electrocution. In both states, inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are killed by lethal injection . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution. It is the sole method of execution in Vermont, where treason is the only capital crime. On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a ""cruel and unusual punishment"" under the state's constitution. This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska, the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution for murder.","Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body.

It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its primary , having 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, resulting in its mass . The Moon is the second densest satellite after Io , a satellite of Jupiter. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun , although its surface is actually very dark, with a reflectance similar to that of coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language , calendars , art and mythology . The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day.

The world's oldest known winery (dated to 3000 BCE) was discovered in Areni-1 cave in a mountainous area of Armenia . URL_http . Increasingly clear archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of the grapevine took place during the Early Bronze Age in the Near East , Sumer and Egypt from around the third millennium BCE. Evidence of the earliest wine production in Balkans has been uncovered at archaeological sites in northern Greece ( Macedonia ), dated to 4500 BC. These same sites also contain remnants of the world's earliest evidence of crushed grapes. In Egypt , wine became a part of recorded history, playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life . Traces of wild wine dating from the second and first millennia BCE have also been found in China. Moroccan wine Kasher label 1930 The Jewish tradition and use of kosher wine is dating back to biblical times . The long history of the use and production of wine throughout ancient Israel is backed up by archeological evidence. Within the Jewish diaspora communities all around the globe, the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day. Wine, linked in myth to Dionysus / Bacchus , was common in ancient Greece and Rome , and many of today's major wine-producing regions of Western Europe were established with Phoenician and, later, Roman plantations. Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known; the design of the wine press advanced; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine. Rashi , a medieval French rabbi and called the ""father"" of all commentaries that followed on the Talmud and the Tanakh, earned his living as a vintner . Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export, the Christian Church in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of wine, necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass. Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures, its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated. Geber and other Muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume . Wine production gradually increased, with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards. Wine production survived the devastating Phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world.","Wine boy at a Greek symposium The history of wine spans thousands of years and is closely intertwined with the history of agriculture , cuisine , civilization and humanity itself.

Increasingly clear archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of the grapevine took place during the Early Bronze Age in the Near East , Sumer and Egypt from around the third millennium BCE. Evidence of the earliest wine production in Balkans has been uncovered at archaeological sites in northern Greece ( Macedonia ), dated to 4500 BC. These same sites also contain remnants of the world's earliest evidence of crushed grapes. In Egypt , wine became a part of recorded history, playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life . Traces of wild wine dating from the second and first millennia BCE have also been found in China. Moroccan wine Kasher label 1930 The Jewish tradition and use of kosher wine is dating back to biblical times . The long history of the use and production of wine throughout ancient Israel is backed up by archeological evidence. Within the Jewish diaspora communities all around the globe, the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day. Wine, linked in myth to Dionysus / Bacchus , was common in ancient Greece and Rome , and many of today's major wine-producing regions of Western Europe were established with Phoenician and, later, Roman plantations. Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known; the design of the wine press advanced; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine. Rashi , a medieval French rabbi and called the ""father"" of all commentaries that followed on the Talmud and the Tanakh, earned his living as a vintner . Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export, the Christian Church in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of wine, necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass. Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures, its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated. Geber and other Muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume . Wine production gradually increased, with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards. Wine production survived the devastating Phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world.",True,True,1.7736501249601133,True,4.544693667034153
1442,Q2862,what is bracketing in photography,Bracketing,"In photography , bracketing is the general technique of taking several shots of the same subject using different camera settings. Bracketing is useful and often recommended in situations that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory image with a single shot, especially when a small variation in exposure parameters has a comparatively large effect on the resulting image. Autobracketing is automatic bracketing by using a setting on the camera to take several bracketed shots (in contrast to the photographer altering the settings by hand between each shot). Given the time it takes to accomplish multiple shots, it is typically, but not always, used for static subjects.","IN PHOTOGRAPHY , BRACKETING IS THE GENERAL TECHNIQUE OF TAKING SEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SAME SUBJECT USING DIFFERENT CAMERA SETTINGS.

210,Q1271,what months are in each season,Season,"A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight . Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant. During May, June and July, the northern hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the sun. The same is true of the southern hemisphere in November, December and January. It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux . However, due to seasonal lag , June, July and August are the hottest months in the northern hemisphere and December, January and February are the hottest months in the southern hemisphere. In temperate and subpolar regions, generally four calendar -based seasons (with their adjectives) are recognized: spring (vernal), summer (estival), autumn (autumnal) and winter (hibernal). However, ecologists mostly use a six season model for temperate climate regions that includes pre-spring (prevernal) and late summer (serotinal) as distinct seasons along with the traditional four.

972,Q2250,what is vitamin a for,Vitamin A,"Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons, which include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important. Vitamin A has multiple functions, it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal , which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the light-absorbing molecule , that is necessary for both low-light ( scotopic vision) and color vision . Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid , which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells. In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester , primarily retinyl palmitate , which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol ) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal . The associated acid (retinoic acid), a metabolite that can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin A, has only partial vitamin A activity, and does not function in the retina for the visual cycle. Retinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiation. All forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached, called a retinyl group. Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity. The orange pigment of carrots – beta-carotene – can be represented as two connected retinyl groups, which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levels. Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group, which give them some vitamin activity. None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity. The carotenoid beta- cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods : Retinol , the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate . The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin (all of which contain beta-ionone rings), but no other carotenoids , function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme (15-15'-dioxygenase) which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it retinol. In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal (resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species).","Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons, which include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important.

Another example might be testing plant fertilizer by giving it to only half the plants in a garden: the plants that receive no fertilizer are the control group, because they establish the baseline level of growth that the fertilizer-treated plants will be compared against. Without a control group, the experiment cannot determine whether the fertilizer-treated plants grow more than they would have if untreated. Ideally, all variables in an experiment will be controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none will be uncontrolled. In such an experiment, if all the controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment is working as intended and that the results of the experiment are due to the effect of the variable being tested.

1649,Q395,what do ancients myths explain,Greek Mythology,"Bust of Zeus , Otricoli (Sala Rotonda, Museo Pio-Clementino , Vatican ). Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks , concerning their gods and heroes , the nature of the world , and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece and is part of religion in modern Greece and around the world , known as Hellenismos . Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. Greek mythology is explicitly embodied in a large collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as vase-paintings and votive gifts . Greek myth attempts to explain the origins of the world, and details the lives and adventures of a wide variety of gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines , and mythological creatures . These accounts initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition ; today the Greek myths are known primarily from Greek literature . The oldest known Greek literary sources, Homer's epic poems Iliad and Odyssey , focus on events surrounding the Trojan War . Two poems by Homer 's near contemporary Hesiod , the Theogony and the Works and Days , contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns , in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle , in lyric poems , in the works of the tragedians of the fifth century BC, in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age , and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias . Archaeological findings provide a principal source of detail about Greek mythology, with gods and heroes featured prominently in the decoration of many artifacts. Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles . In the succeeding Archaic , Classical , and Hellenistic periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.

Roosevelt signs the Lend-Lease bill to give aid to Britain and China (1941) The Lend Lease act was an act where the United States had supported its allies. Lend-Lease () was the law that started a program under which the United States of America supplied the United Kingdom , the USSR , Republic of China , Free France , and other Allied nations with materiel between 1941 and 1945. It was signed into law on March 11, 1941, a year and a half after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939. This was nine months before the U.S. entered the war in December 1941. Formally titled An Act to Further Promote the Defense of the United States, the Act effectively ended the United States' pretense of neutrality . A total of $50 .1 billion (equivalent to $ today) worth of supplies were shipped: $31.4 billion to Britain, $11.3 billion to the Soviet Union, $3.2 billion to France, $1.6 billion to China, and smaller sums to other Allies. Reverse Lend-Lease comprised services such as rent on air bases that went to the U.S., and totaled $7.8 billion; of this, $6.8 billion came from the British and the Commonwealth . The terms of the agreement provided that the materiel was to be used until time for their return or destruction. Supplies after the termination date were sold to Britain at a large discount for £1 .075 billion using long-term loans from the United States. Canada operated a similar program that sent $4.7 billion in supplies to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The United States did not charge for aid supplied under this legislation.

769,Q1998,when did the titanic sink,RMS Titanic,"RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton , UK to New York City , US. The sinking of Titanic caused the deaths of 1,502 people in one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. The RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of her maiden voyage. She was the second of three Olympic class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line , and she was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast with Thomas Andrews , who perished with the ship, as her naval architect. On her maiden voyage, she carried 2,224 passengers and crew. Under the command of Edward Smith , her passengers included some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland , Scandinavia and elsewhere throughout Europe seeking a new life in North America. The ship was designed to be the last word in comfort and luxury, with an on-board gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. She also had a powerful wireless telegraph provided for the convenience of passengers as well as for operational use. Though she had advanced safety features such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, she lacked enough lifeboats to accommodate all of those aboard. Because of outdated maritime safety regulations, she carried only enough lifeboats for 1,178 people—slightly more than half of the number travelling on the maiden voyage, and one-third her total passenger and crew capacity. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown (now Cobh ) in Ireland before heading westwards towards New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of Newfoundland , she hit an iceberg at 11:40 pm ship's time. The glancing collision caused Titanics hull plates to buckle inwards along her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen watertight compartments to the sea; the ship gradually filled with water. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partly loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "" women and children first "" protocol followed by some of the officers loading the lifeboats. By 2:20 AM, she broke apart and foundered, with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after the Titanic foundered, the Cunard liner RMS Carpathia arrived on the scene of the sinking, where she brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors. The disaster was greeted with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life and the regulatory and operational failures that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety . One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications---which could have saved many more passengers. Many of the survivors lost all of their money and possessions and were left destitute; many families, particularly those of crew members from Southampton, lost their primary bread-winners. They were helped by an outpouring of public sympathy and charitable donations. Some of the male survivors were accused of cowardice for leaving the ship while people were still on board; the White Star Line's chairman, J. Bruce Ismay , faced social ostracism for the rest of his life. The wreck of the Titanic remains on the seabed, split in two and gradually disintegrating at a depth of .

1752,Q53,how bad burns go to burn center,Burn,"A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation . Most burns affect only the superficial skin (known as superficial or first degree) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin (known as partial thickness or second degree). Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness (third degree) or fourth degree. The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns maybe managed with little more than simple pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers . Cooling with tap water may aid pain and decrease damage however if exposure is prolonged it may result in low body temperature . Partial thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water followed by dressings. Blisters should typically be left unbroken. Full thickness burns usually require surgical treatments such as skin grafting and extensive burns often require large amount of intravenous fluids .

Globally about 11 million people seek medical treatment and 300,000 people die from burns. In the United States, of those admitted to a burn center , approximately 4% die from their injuries. The long term outcome is primarily related to the size of burn and the age of the person effected.","A burn is a type of injury to flesh or skin caused by heat , electricity , chemicals , friction , or radiation . Most burns affect only the superficial skin (known as superficial or first degree) or extend into the deeper skin but do not involve the full thickness of the skin (known as partial thickness or second degree). Rarely all layers of the skin or deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone can be injured in which case the burn is either full thickness (third degree) or fourth degree. The treatment required depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns maybe managed with little more than simple pain killers while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers . Cooling with tap water may aid pain and decrease damage however if exposure is prolonged it may result in low body temperature .

1420,Q283,how many canals in mandibular first molar,Mandibular first molar,"The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face ) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second molars . It is located on the mandibular (lower) arch of the mouth, and generally opposes the maxillary (upper) first molars and the maxillary 2nd premolar in normal class I occlusion. The function of this molar is similar to that of all molars in regard to grinding being the principal action during mastication , commonly known as chewing. There are usually five well-developed cusps on mandibular first molars: two on the buccal (side nearest the cheek), two lingual (side nearest the tongue ), and one distal. There are great differences between the deciduous (baby) mandibular molars and those of the permanent mandibular molars, even though their function are similar. The permanent mandibular molars are not considered to have any teeth that precede it. Despite being named molars, the deciduous molars are followed by permanent premolars. In the universal system of notation , the deciduous mandibular first molars are designated by a letter written in uppercase. The right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""S"", and the left one is known as ""L"". The international notation has a different system of notation. Thus, the right deciduous mandibular first molar is known as ""84"", and the left one is known as ""74"". In the universal system of notation, the permanent mandibular first molars are designated by a number. The right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""30"", and the left one is known as ""19"". The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. For this tooth, the left and right first molars would have the same number, ""6"", but the right one would have the symbol, ""┐"", over it, while the left one would have, ""┌"". The international notation has a different numbering system than the previous two, and the right permanent mandibular first molar is known as ""46"", and the left one is known as ""36"". Mandibular primary first molars usually have four pulp horns. The first molar is usually the first permanent tooth to erupt and has adult undertones. Anatomy: The mandibular first molar has five cusps: the mesiobuccal (MB, toward midline and cheek), mesiolingual (ML, toward midline and tongue), distolingual (DL, away from midline and towards tongue), distobuccal (DB, away from midline and toward cheek), and distal (D, away from midline), listed in order of decreasing size. Listed in order of decreasing height they are: ML, DL, DF, MF, and D. An eighth cusp was found in a primary second lower molar in an Argentinean child. Viewed from the top of the tooth (occlusal view), the mandibular first molar is pentagonal (five sided) in shape and tapers toward the lingual, with the sides being the buccal surface, the mesial surface, the lingual surface, distal surface, and the distobuccal surface. The occlusal surface has four grooves. The central groove is not straight but runs down the center of the tooth mesially to distally and contains four pits (mesial, central, central, and distal). The distobuccal groove runs from the distal pit in the central groove distobuccally separating the distal and distobuccal cusps. The lingual groove runs from the more distal of the central pits in the central groove toward the lingual surface between the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps. The buccal groove runs from the more mesial of the central pits in the central groove toward the buccal surface between the mesiobuccal and distobuccal cusps ending in the buccal pit. The portion of the central groove between the central pits is termed the Lewis offset and is mandatory to account for the locations of the buccal and lingual grooves (buccal groove being more mesial than the lingual groove while they are parallel). From the buccal (buccal view), two roots are present. The distal root is generally straighter, although both often have a slight distal curvature. The heights of contour on the mesial and distal contact the adjacent teeth and are located at the junction of the occlusal and middle thirds of the crown.","The mandibular first molar or six-year molar is the tooth located distally (away from the midline of the face ) from both the mandibular second premolars of the mouth but mesial (toward the midline of the face) from both mandibular second molars .

1081,Q239,what does metes and bounds mean,Metes and bounds,"Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land, real property (in contrast to personal property) or real estate . The system has been used in England for many centuries, and is still used there in the definition of general boundaries. By custom, it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States , and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law . Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography , along with directions and distances, to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of land. The boundaries are described in a running prose style, working around the parcel in sequence, from a point of beginning , returning back to the same point; compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds . It may include references to other adjoining parcels (and their owners), and it, in turn, could also be referred to in later surveys. At the time the description is compiled, it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monuments. The term ""metes"" refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run, specified by a distance between the terminal points, and an orientation or direction. A direction may be a simple compass bearing, or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methods. The term ""bounds"" refers to a more general boundary description, such as along a certain watercourse, a stone wall, an adjoining public road way, or an existing building.

1805,Q598,what countries legalize marijuana,Legality of cannabis,"The legality of cannabis varies from country to country. Possession of cannabis is illegal in most countries and has been since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition in the late 1930s. However, many countries have decriminalized the possession of small quantities of cannabis, particularly in North America , South America and Europe . Furthermore, possession is legal or effectively legal in the Netherlands , North Korea and would be in the U.S. states of Colorado and Washington if it were not for federal law, which governs persons in all states. The medicinal use of cannabis is legal in a number of countries, including Canada , the Czech Republic and Israel . While federal law in the United States bans all sale and possession of cannabis, enforcement varies widely at the state level and some states have established medicinal marijuana programs in that contradict federal law; two states ( Colorado and Washington ) have repealed their laws prohibiting the recreational use of cannabis and replaced them with a regulatory regime, also contrary to federal statute. Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but, apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana, most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe. Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation, use, possession or transfer of cannabis for recreational use. A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis, making it punishable by confiscation and a fine , rather than imprisonment . Some jurisdictions/ drug courts use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users, with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes. There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in Canada . Drug tests to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs. However, simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries, particularly in parts of East Asia and Southeast Asia where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution.","The legality of cannabis varies from country to country.

1981,Q816,what does the royal family do,British Royal Family,"The British Royal Family is the group of close relatives of the monarch of the United Kingdom . The term is also commonly applied to the same group of people who are the relations of the monarch in her or his role as sovereign of any of the other Commonwealth realms , thus sometimes at variance with official national terms for the family. Members of the Royal Family belong to, either by birth or marriage, the House of Windsor , since 1917, when George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha . This decision was primarily taken because Britain and her Empire were at war with Germany and given the British Royal Family's strong German ancestry; it was felt that its public image could be improved by choosing a more British house name. The new name chosen, Windsor, had absolutely no connection other than as the name of the castle which was and continues to be a royal residence. Although in the United Kingdom there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the Royal Family, and different lists will include different people, those carrying the style Her or His Majesty (HM) , or Her or His Royal Highness (HRH) are always considered members, which usually results in the application of the term to the monarch, the consort of the monarch, the widowed consorts of previous monarchs, the children of the monarch and previous monarchs, the male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, and the spouses and the widows of a monarch's and previous monarch's sons and male-line grandsons. On 30 November 1917, King George V issued Letters Patent defining who are members of the Royal Family; the text of the notice from the London Gazette is as follows: In 1996, Her Majesty The Queen modified these Letters Patent, as was evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette: In 2013 Letters Patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the Royal Family to additional persons to be born, evidenced by this Notice from the London Gazette: Members and relatives of the British Royal Family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the British Empire , sometimes for extended periods as viceroys , or for specific ceremonies or events. Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Aside from the monarch, their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve, if eligible and when appointed by letters patent, as a Counsellor of State , two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown (within stipulated limits) in the indisposal or absence from the British realm of the monarch. In the other realms of the Commonwealth royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State. However in each such realm the monarch's family members may act on behalf of, are funded by, and represent the sovereign of that particular state, and not the United Kingdom.

Wives of the said enjoy their husbands' precedence, and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well. However, the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the Royal Family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra, who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall, who is otherwise the realm's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself.

Alexander Joseph ""Lex"" Luthor is a fictional character , a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics . Luthor is the archenemy of Superman , and as a high-status supervillain, has also come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe . Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster , the character first appeared in Action Comics #23 (April 1940 ). Luthor is described as ""a power-mad, evil scientist"" of high intelligence and incredible technological prowess. Luthor's goals typically center on killing Superman, the foremost obstacle to achieving the villain's megalomaniacal goals. Despite periodically wearing a powered exoskeleton , Luthor has traditionally lacked superpowers or a dual identity . The character was originally depicted as a mad scientist who, in the vein of pulp novels , wreaks havoc on the world with his futuristic weaponry. In his earliest appearances, Luthor is shown with a full head of red hair . Despite this, the character later became hairless as the result of an artist's mistake. A 1960 story by Jerry Siegel expanded upon Luthor's origin and motivations, revealing him to be a childhood friend of Superman 's who lost his hair when a fire destroyed his laboratory; Luthor vowed revenge. Following the 1985 limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths , the character was re-imagined as a Machiavellian industrialist and white-collar criminal, even briefly serving as President of the United States .

494,Q1626,what president was theodore roosevelt,Theodore Roosevelt,"Theodore ""T.R."" Roosevelt, Jr. ( ; October 27, 1858—January 6, 1919) was the 26th President of the United States (1901–1909). He is noted for his exuberant personality, range of interests and achievements, and his leadership of the Progressive Movement , as well as his "" cowboy "" persona and robust masculinity . He was a leader of the Republican Party and founder of the first incarnation of the short-lived Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party of 1912 . Before becoming President, he held offices at the city, state, and federal levels. Roosevelt's achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as a politician. Roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as President of the United States in 1901, making him the youngest president ever; he beat out the youngest elected president, John F. Kennedy , by only one year. Roosevelt was also the first of only three sitting presidents to have won the Nobel Peace Prize . The Teddy bear is named after him, despite his contempt for being called ""Teddy"". Born into a wealthy family in New York City, Roosevelt was a sickly child who suffered from asthma and stayed at home studying natural history . To overcome his physical weakness, he embraced a strenuous life. Home-schooled, he became an eager student of nature. He attended Harvard University , where he studied biology, boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs. In 1881, one year out of Harvard, he was elected to the New York State Assembly , where he became a leader of the reform faction of his Republican Party (the ""GOP""). His The Naval War of 1812 (1882) established his professional reputation as a serious historian; he wrote numerous books on hunting, the outdoors, and current political issues, as well as frontier history. In 1884, his first wife and his mother died on the same day. He temporarily left politics and went to the frontier, becoming a rancher in the ""Badlands"" in the Dakotas. Returning to New York City, he ran for mayor in 1886, finishing third with 60,000 votes. He later gained fame by taking vigorous charge of the city police. At the national level, he was a leader in civil service reform. The Spanish–American War broke out in 1898 while Roosevelt was, effectively, running the Department of the Navy . He promptly resigned and formed the Rough Riders – a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in Cuba . The war hero was elected governor in 1898 and in 1900 was nominated for vice president. He successfully energized the GOP base as a highly visible campaigner to reelect President William McKinley on a platform of high tariffs, the gold standard, imperialism, prosperity at home and victory abroad. In 1901, President William McKinley was assassinated and Roosevelt became President. He attempted to move the Republican Party (GOP) toward Progressivism , including trust busting and increased regulation of businesses. Roosevelt became the first person elected to a term in his own right in 1904 after having ascended to the Presidency (from the Vice-Presidency) upon the death of his predecessor, winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since the uncontested election of 1820 . Roosevelt coined the phrase "" Square Deal "" to describe his domestic agenda, emphasizing that the average citizen would get a fair share under his policies. As an outdoorsman and naturalist, he promoted the conservation movement .

1099,Q2409,what is leasehold; real estate,Leasehold estate,"A leasehold estate is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a lessee or a tenant holds rights of real property by some form of title from a lessor or landlord . Although a tenant does hold rights to real property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property. Leasehold is a form of land tenure or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time. As lease is a legal estate, leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market. A leasehold thus differs from a freehold or fee simple where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time, and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let (rented) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly. Until the end of the lease period (often measured in decades or centuries; a 99 year lease is quite common) the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner. Terms of the agreement are contained in a lease , which has elements of contract and property law intertwined. The term estate for years may occasionally be used. This refers to a leasehold estate for any specific period of time (the word ""years"" is misleading). An estate for years is not automatically renewed.

The Presidential palace, Parliament and many other important structures were destroyed, along with countless homes and businesses, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless. The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake (and subsequent incidents) due to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010, as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake.

Most recently, in February 2004, a coup d'état originating in the north of the country forced the resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . A provisional government took control with security provided by the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Michel Martelly , the current president, was elected in the Haitian general election, 2011 . The island has had a history of destructive earthquakes. A 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti on 12 January 2010 and devastated Port-au-Prince. The highest reliable death count was estimated at 220,000. Haitian government estimates were higher. The Presidential palace, Parliament and many other important structures were destroyed, along with countless homes and businesses, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless. The country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake (and subsequent incidents) due to both the severity of the damage Haiti endured in 2010, as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquake. United States aid organizations have donated $2 billion. Combined with other international donations, these funds are intended to contribute to the rebuilding of the country.",False,True,2.331603707978502,True,3.752405417035334

347,Q1438,"what is ""thin film"" technology",Thin film,"A thin film is a layer of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer ( monolayer ) to several micrometers in thickness. Electronic semiconductor devices and optical coatings are the main applications benefiting from thin-film construction. A familiar application of thin films is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors. A very-thin-film coating (less than a nanometer thick) is used to produce two-way mirrors . The performance of optical coatings (e.g. antireflective , or AR, coatings) are typically enhanced when the thin-film coating consists of multiple layers having varying thicknesses and refractive indices . Similarly, a periodic structure of alternating thin films of different materials may collectively form a so-called superlattice which exploits the phenomenon of quantum confinement by restricting electronic phenomena to two-dimensions. Work is being done with ferromagnetic and ferroelectric thin films for use as computer memory . It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via thin-film drug delivery . Thin-films are used to produce thin-film batteries . Thin films are also used in dye-sensitized solar cells . Ceramic thin films are in wide use. The relatively high hardness and inertness of ceramic materials make this type of thin coating of interest for protection of substrate materials against corrosion, oxidation and wear. In particular, the use of such coatings on cutting tools can extend the life of these items by several orders of magnitude. Research is being done on a new class of thin-film inorganic oxide materials, called amorphous heavy-metal cation multicomponent oxides, which could be used to make transparent transistors that are inexpensive, stable, and environmentally benign.","A THIN FILM IS A LAYER OF MATERIAL RANGING FROM FRACTIONS OF A NANOMETER ( MONOLAYER ) TO SEVERAL MICROMETERS IN THICKNESS.

Our Gang (also known as The Little Rascals or Hal Roach's Rascals) are a series of American comedy short films about a group of poor neighborhood children and their adventures. Created by comedy producer Hal Roach , the series is noted for showing children behaving in a relatively natural way, as Roach and original director Robert F. McGowan worked to film the unaffected, raw nuances apparent in regular children rather than have them imitate adult acting styles. In addition, Our Gang notably put boys, girls, whites and blacks together in a group as equals, something that ""broke new ground,"" according to film historian Leonard Maltin . Such a thing had never been done before in cinema but has since been repeated after the success of Our Gang. The first production at the Roach studio in 1922 was a series of silent short subjects. When Roach changed distributors from Pathé to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1927, and converted the series to sound in 1929, the series took off even further. Production continued at the Roach studio until 1938, when the series was sold to MGM, who then continued producing the comedies until 1944. The Our Gang series includes a total of 220 shorts and one feature film, General Spanky , featuring over forty-one child actors . As MGM retained the rights to the Our Gang trademark following their purchase of the production rights, the 80 Roach-produced ""talkies"" were syndicated for television under the title The Little Rascals beginning in 1955. Both Roach's The Little Rascals package (now owned by CBS Television Distribution ) and MGM's Our Gang package (now owned by Warner Bros.

1708,Q474,how much water is the human body made of,Body water,"In physiology , body water is the water content of the human body . A significant fraction of the human body is water. Arthur Guyton 's Textbook of Medical Physiology states that ""the total amount of water in a man of average weight (70 kilograms) is approximately 40 litres, averaging 57 percent of his total body weight. In a newborn infant, this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight, but it progressively decreases from birth to old age, most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of life. Also, obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body, sometimes to as low as 45 percent"". These figures are statistical averages, so are illustrative, and like all biostatistics, will vary with things like type of population, age and number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure. For example, Jackson's (1985) Anatomy & Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60% for the proportion of body-weight attributable to water, which approximates Guyton's 57%. In diseased states where body water is affected, the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem. Body water is regulated by hormones , including anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide . Per Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology, body water is broken down into the following compartments: Intracellular fluid (2/3 of body water). Per Guyton, in a body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5% (5/8), close enough to the 2/3 rule of thumb. Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular. Extracellular fluid (1/3 of body water). Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5% Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here. Plasma (1/5 of extracellular fluid).

1433,Q2851,where is thomas more buried,Thomas More,"Sir Thomas More (; 7 February 14786 July 1535), known to Roman Catholics as Saint Thomas More since 1935, was an English lawyer, social philosopher , author, statesman , and noted Renaissance humanist . He was an important councillor to Henry VIII of England and was Lord Chancellor from October 1529 to 16 May 1532. He was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935 as one of the early martyrs of the schism that separated the Church of England from Rome in the 16th century. In 2000, Pope John Paul II declared him patron of Catholic statesmen and politicians. More was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation , in particular of Martin Luther and William Tyndale . However, since 1980, he is also commemorated by the Church of England as a reformation martyr. More coined the word "" utopia "" – a name he gave to the ideal and imaginary island nation, the political system of which he described in Utopia , published in 1516. He opposed the King's separation from the Roman Catholic Church and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England , a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534 . He was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath required by the First Succession Act , because the act disparaged Papal Authority and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon . In 1535, he was tried for treason , convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded. More also helped to originate the phrase ""grasp at straws"" to mean ""desperately trying even useless things"", in his Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation. Intellectuals and statesmen across Europe were stunned by More's execution. Erasmus saluted him as one ""whose soul was more pure than any snow, whose genius was such that England never had and never again will have its like"". There was a more controversial side to More's life, because he advocated the persecution and execution of Protestants who refused to recant their faith. However, the judgement of history has been largely willing to forgive this in light of the times he lived in and his martyrdom in the Roman Catholic cause. Two centuries later Jonathan Swift said More was ""the person of the greatest virtue this kingdom ever produced"", a sentiment with which Samuel Johnson agreed.
