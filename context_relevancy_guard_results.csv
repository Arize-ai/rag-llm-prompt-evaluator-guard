968,Q2246,what is lean manufacturing and who developed,Lean manufacturing,"Lean manufacturing, lean enterprise, or lean production, often simply, ""Lean,"" is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, ""value"" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Essentially, lean is centered on preserving value with less work. Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy derived mostly from the Toyota Production System (TPS) (hence the term Toyotism is also prevalent) and identified as ""Lean"" only in the 1990s. TPS is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original Toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value, but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved. The steady growth of Toyota , from a small company to the world's largest automaker, has focused attention on how it has achieved this success.","LEAN MANUFACTURING, LEAN ENTERPRISE, OR LEAN PRODUCTION, OFTEN SIMPLY, ""LEAN,"" IS A PRODUCTION PRACTICE THAT CONSIDERS THE EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES FOR ANY GOAL OTHER THAN THE CREATION OF VALUE FOR THE END CUSTOMER TO BE WASTEFUL, AND THUS A TARGET FOR ELIMINATION.

1224,Q2572,what is rationalism by john locke george berkeley,George Berkeley,"George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers , and as a result cannot exist without being perceived. Thus, as Berkeley famously put it, for physical objects ""esse est percipi"" ("" to be is to be perceived ""). Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction , an important premise in his argument for immaterialism. In 1709, Berkeley published his first major work, , in which he discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects, but light and colour. This foreshadowed his chief philosophical work A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge in 1710 which, after its poor reception, he rewrote in dialogue form and published under the title Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous in 1713. In this book, Berkeley's views were represented by Philonous (Greek: 'lover of mind'), while Hylas (Greek: 'matter') embodies the Irish thinker’s opponents, in particular John Locke . Berkeley argued against Sir Isaac Newton 's doctrine of absolute space , time and motion in De Motu (on Motion), published 1721. His arguments were a precursor to the views of Mach and Einstein . In 1732, he published Alciphron , a Christian apologetic against the free-thinkers , and in 1734, he published The Analyst , an empiricist critique of the foundations of infinitesimal calculus , which was influential in the development of mathematics. His last major philosophical work, Siris (1744), begins by advocating the medicinal use of tar water , and then continues to discuss a wide range of topics including science, philosophy, and theology. Interest in Berkeley's work increased after World War II, because he tackled many of the issues of paramount interest to philosophy in the 20th century such as the problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.","George Berkeley (; 12 March 168514 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley ( Bishop of Cloyne ), was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as "" subjective idealism "" by others).

1721,Q488,how many died in hiroshima and nagasaki,Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"The atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan were conducted by the United States during the final stages of World War II in 1945. The two events are the only use of nuclear weapons in war to date. Following a firebombing campaign that destroyed many Japanese cities, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of Japan . The war in Europe ended when Nazi Germany signed its instrument of surrender on 8 May, but the Pacific War continued. Together with the United Kingdom and the Republic of China , the United States called for a surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, threatening Japan with ""prompt and utter destruction"". The Japanese government ignored this ultimatum, and the United States deployed two nuclear weapons developed by the Manhattan Project . American airmen dropped Little Boy on the city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, followed by Fat Man over Nagasaki on 9 August. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the acute effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki, with roughly half of the deaths in each city occurring on the first day. The Hiroshima prefecture health department estimated that, of the people who died on the day of the explosion, 60% died from flash or flame burns, 30% from falling debris and 10% from other causes. During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness , and other injuries, compounded by illness. In a US estimate of the total immediate and short term cause of death, 15–20% died from radiation sickness, 20–30% from burns, and 50–60% from other injuries, compounded by illness. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison. On 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies, signing the Instrument of Surrender on 2 September, officially ending World War II. The bombings led, in part, to post-war Japan 's adopting Three Non-Nuclear Principles , forbidding the nation from nuclear armament.

252,Q1321,what state was the civil war in,American Civil War,"The American Civil War (ACW), also known as the War between the States or simply the Civil War (see naming ), was a civil war fought from 1861 to 1865 between the United States (the ""Union"" or the ""North"") and several Southern slave states that declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America (the ""Confederacy"" or the ""South""). The war had its origin in the issue of slavery , especially the extension of slavery into the western territories. Foreign powers did not intervene. After four years of bloody combat that left over 600,000 soldiers dead and destroyed much of the South's infrastructure, the Confederacy collapsed, slavery was abolished, and the difficult Reconstruction process of restoring national unity and guaranteeing rights to the freed slaves began. In the 1860 presidential election , Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln , opposed expanding slavery into United States' territories . Lincoln won, but before his inauguration on March 4, 1861, seven cotton-based slave states formed the Confederacy. Outgoing Democratic President James Buchanan and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. Lincoln's inaugural address declared his administration would not initiate civil war. Eight remaining slave states continued to reject calls for secession. Confederate forces seized numerous federal forts within territory claimed by the Confederacy. A Peace Conference failed to find a compromise, and both sides prepared for war. The Confederates assumed that European countries were so dependent on "" King Cotton "" that they would intervene; none did and none recognized the new Confederate States of America. Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired upon Fort Sumter , a key fort held by Union troops in South Carolina. Lincoln called for each state to provide troops to retake the fort; consequently, four more slave states joined the Confederacy, bringing their total to eleven. The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. The Eastern Theater was inconclusive in 1861–62. The autumn 1862 Confederate campaign into Maryland (a Union state) ended with Confederate retreat at the Battle of Antietam , dissuading British intervention. Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation , which made ending slavery a war goal. To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of their western armies, and the Union at Vicksburg split the Confederacy in two at the Mississippi River. In 1863, Robert E. Lee's Confederate incursion north ended at the Battle of Gettysburg . Western successes led to Ulysses S. Grant command of all Union armies in 1864. In the Western Theater, William T. Sherman drove east to capture Atlanta and marched to the sea , destroying Confederate infrastructure along the way. The Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, and could afford to fight battles of attrition through the Overland Campaign towards Richmond, the Confederate capital. The defending Confederate army failed, leading to Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The American Civil War was one of the earliest true industrial wars . Railroads, the telegraph, steamships, and mass-produced weapons were employed extensively. The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation and food supplies all foreshadowed World War I . It remains the deadliest war in American history , resulting in the deaths of an estimated 750,000 soldiers and an undetermined number of civilian casualties.

The latter is a relatively rare side effect of many drugs, particularly those that affect the central nervous system . Malignant hyperthermia is a rare complication of some types of general anesthesia . Hyperthermia can also be deliberately induced using drugs or medical devices and may be used in the treatment of some kinds of cancer and other conditions, most commonly in conjunction with radiotherapy . Hyperthermia differs from fever in that the body's temperature set point remains unchanged.

As granted by the Constitution ( Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 ), Presidents have the power to grant clemency in one or more of the following ways: the ability to grant a full pardon , to commute a sentence, or to rescind a fine. U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law. As to the difference between a pardon and a commutation: A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction. A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself. Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone. The records of acts of clemency were public until 1934. In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President H. W. Bush forward are now listed.

U.S. Presidents have no power to grant clemency for crimes prosecuted under state law. As to the difference between a pardon and a commutation: A pardon is an executive order vacating a conviction. A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself. Approximately 20,000 pardons and clemencies were issued by U.S. presidents in the 20th century alone. The records of acts of clemency were public until 1934. In 1981 the Office of the Pardon Attorney was created and records from President H. W. Bush forward are now listed.

841,Q2084,what was john adams doing to help france,John Adams,"John Adams (October 30, 1735 ( O.S. October 19, 1735) – July 4, 1826) was the second president of the United States (1797–1801), having earlier served as the first vice president of the United States . An American Founding Father , he was a statesman, diplomat, and a leading advocate of American independence from Great Britain . Well educated, he was an Enlightenment political theorist who promoted republicanism and wrote prolifically about his often seminal ideas, both in published works and in letters to his wife and key adviser Abigail as well as to other Founding Fathers . Adams came to prominence in the early stages of the American Revolution . A lawyer and public figure in Boston , as a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress , he played a leading role in persuading Congress to declare independence. He assisted Thomas Jefferson in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776, and was its primary advocate in the Congress. Later, as a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the eventual peace treaty with Great Britain , and was responsible for obtaining vital governmental loans from Amsterdam bankers. A political theorist and historian, Adams largely wrote the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780, which together with his earlier Thoughts on Government , influenced American political thought. One of his greatest roles was as a judge of character: in 1775, he nominated George Washington to be commander-in-chief , and 25 years later nominated John Marshall to be Chief Justice of the United States . Adams' revolutionary credentials secured him two terms as George Washington 's vice president and his own election in 1796 as the second president. During his one term, he encountered ferocious attacks by the Jeffersonian Republicans , as well as the dominant faction in his own Federalist Party led by his bitter enemy Alexander Hamilton . Adams signed the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts , and built up the army and navy especially in the face of an undeclared naval war (called the "" Quasi-War "") with France , 1798–1800. The major accomplishment of his presidency was his peaceful resolution of the conflict in the face of Hamilton's opposition. In 1800, Adams was defeated for re-election by Thomas Jefferson and retired to Massachusetts. He later resumed his friendship with Jefferson. He and his wife, Abigail Adams , founded an accomplished family line of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political family . Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams , the sixth President of the United States. His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders.

670,Q1855,what states has the electric chair,Electric chair,"Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body. This execution method was created by employees of Thomas Edison during the War of Currents , and has been used only in the United States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines (its first use there in 1924 under American occupation , last in 1976). Historically, once the condemned person was attached to the chair , various cycles (differing in voltage and duration) of alternating current would be passed through the individual's body, in order to cause fatal damage to the internal organs (including the brain). The first jolt of electric current was designed to cause immediate unconsciousness and brain death ; the second one was designed to cause fatal damage to the vital organs. Death was frequently caused by electrical overstimulation of the heart . Although in the United States the electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty , its use is in decline due to the rise of lethal injection , which is widely believed to be a more humane method of execution. Although some states still maintain electrocution as a method of execution, today it is only maintained as a secondary method that may be chosen over lethal injection at the request of the prisoner. As of 2010, electrocution is an optional form of execution in Alabama , Florida , South Carolina and Virginia . They allow the prisoner to choose lethal injection as an alternative method. In the states of Kentucky and Tennessee , the electric chair has been retired except for those whose capital crimes were committed prior to legislated dates in 1998 (Kentucky: March 31, 1998; Tennessee: December 31, 1998) and who chose electrocution. In both states, inmates who do not choose electrocution or inmates who committed their crimes after the designated date are killed by lethal injection . The electric chair is an alternate form of execution approved for potential use in Arkansas and Oklahoma if other forms of execution are found unconstitutional in the state at the time of execution. It is the sole method of execution in Vermont, where treason is the only capital crime. On February 8, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was a ""cruel and unusual punishment"" under the state's constitution. This brought executions of this type to an end in Nebraska, the only remaining state to retain electrocution as its sole method of execution for murder.","Old Sparky, the electric chair used at Sing Sing prison Execution by electrocution, usually performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes placed on the body.

It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its primary , having 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, resulting in its mass . The Moon is the second densest satellite after Io , a satellite of Jupiter. The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters . It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun , although its surface is actually very dark, with a reflectance similar to that of coal. Its prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have, since ancient times, made the Moon an important cultural influence on language , calendars , art and mythology . The Moon's gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the day. The Moon's current orbital distance, about thirty times the diameter of the Earth, causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses .

The Moon is thought to have formed nearly 4.5 billion years ago, not long after the Earth. Although there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past, the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars -sized body. The Moon is the only celestial body other than Earth on which humans have set foot . The Soviet Union 's Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959; the United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date, beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972, with the first being Apollo 11 . These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks , which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon's origins, the formation of its internal structure , and its subsequent history .

The world's oldest known winery (dated to 3000 BCE) was discovered in Areni-1 cave in a mountainous area of Armenia . URL_http . Increasingly clear archaeological evidence indicates that domestication of the grapevine took place during the Early Bronze Age in the Near East , Sumer and Egypt from around the third millennium BCE. Evidence of the earliest wine production in Balkans has been uncovered at archaeological sites in northern Greece ( Macedonia ), dated to 4500 BC. These same sites also contain remnants of the world's earliest evidence of crushed grapes. In Egypt , wine became a part of recorded history, playing an important role in ancient ceremonial life . Traces of wild wine dating from the second and first millennia BCE have also been found in China. Moroccan wine Kasher label 1930 The Jewish tradition and use of kosher wine is dating back to biblical times . The long history of the use and production of wine throughout ancient Israel is backed up by archeological evidence. Within the Jewish diaspora communities all around the globe, the traditional and religious use of kosher wine continued to this day. Wine, linked in myth to Dionysus / Bacchus , was common in ancient Greece and Rome , and many of today's major wine-producing regions of Western Europe were established with Phoenician and, later, Roman plantations. Winemaking technology improved considerably during the time of the Roman Empire : many grape varieties and cultivation techniques were known; the design of the wine press advanced; and barrels were developed for storing and shipping wine. Rashi , a medieval French rabbi and called the ""father"" of all commentaries that followed on the Talmud and the Tanakh, earned his living as a vintner . Following the decline of Rome and its industrial-scale wine production for export, the Christian Church in medieval Europe also became a firm supporter of wine, necessary for celebration of the Catholic Mass. Whereas wine was forbidden in medieval Islamic cultures, its use in Christian libation was widely tolerated. Geber and other Muslim chemists pioneered the distillation of wine for Islamic medicinal and industrial purposes such as perfume . Wine production gradually increased, with consumption burgeoning from the 15th century onwards. Wine production survived the devastating Phylloxera louse of 1887 and eventually spread to numerous regions throughout the world.","Wine boy at a Greek symposium The history of wine spans thousands of years and is closely intertwined with the history of agriculture , cuisine , civilization and humanity itself.
