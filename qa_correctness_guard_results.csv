The nation is also a notable producer of tin, tungsten and uranium. However, the country lacks the potential to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and aluminium, a limitation that has hindered the development of Portugal's mining and metallurgy sectors. Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves—mainly in the north—after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization, low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals. The Panasqueira and Neves-Corvo mines are among the most recognised Portuguese mines that are still in operation.[citation needed]",What event triggered a decrease in the extraction of Portugal's natural resources?,1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization,True,The decrease in the extraction of Portugal's natural resources was triggered by the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755.,The decrease in the extraction of Portugal's natural resources was triggered by the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755.,False,False,2.2814217080012895,False,1.6978826660197228

It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects. Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things. The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything. But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves. A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that:",What is the general materialistic view of an object?,Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things,True,"The general materialistic view of an object is that it is intrinsically connected to all other objects, with relationships and interactions being the core of its existence.",Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things,True,True,2.9369105000514537,True,1.625403166981414

Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds.
