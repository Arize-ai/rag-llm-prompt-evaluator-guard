2322,573405584776f41900661711,Portugal,"Portugal is a significant European minerals producer and is ranked among Europe's leading copper producers. The nation is also a notable producer of tin, tungsten and uranium. However, the country lacks the potential to conduct hydrocarbon exploration and aluminium, a limitation that has hindered the development of Portugal's mining and metallurgy sectors. Although the country has vast iron and coal reserves—mainly in the north—after the 1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization, low competitiveness forced a decrease in the extraction activity for these minerals. The Panasqueira and Neves-Corvo mines are among the most recognised Portuguese mines that are still in operation.[citation needed]",What event triggered a decrease in the extraction of Portugal's natural resources?,1974 revolution and the consequent economic globalization,True,The decrease in the extraction of Portugal's natural resources was triggered by the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755.,The decrease in the extraction of Portugal's natural resources was triggered by the Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755.,False,False,2.5938776250113733,False,9.626770167029463

It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects. Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things. The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything. But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves. A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that:",What is the general materialistic view of an object?,Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things,True,"The general materialistic view of an object is that it is intrinsically connected to all other objects, with relationships and interactions being the core of its existence.",Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things,True,True,2.2560009579756297,False,6.736560833989643

This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses.

These fundamental questions involved a conceptual distinction between the concepts of ""state"" and ""government."" It was decided that ""state"" would refer to a set of enduring institutions through which power would be distributed and its use justified. The term ""government"" would refer to a specific group of people who occupied the institutions of the state, and create the laws and ordinances by which the people, themselves included, would be bound. This conceptual distinction continues to operate in political science, although some political scientists, philosophers, historians and cultural anthropologists have argued that most political action in any given society occurs outside of its state, and that there are societies that are not organized into states that nevertheless must be considered in political terms. As long as the concept of natural order was not introduced, the social sciences could not evolve independently of theistic thinking.

The plan led the Sui dynasty to restore and expand the network which became the Grand Canal of China. The Canal regularly transported grains and resources from Zhejiang, through its metropolitan center Hangzhou (and its hinterland along both the Zhe River and the shores of Hangzhou Bay), and from Suzhou, and thence to the North China Plain. The débâcle of the Korean war led to Sui's overthrow by the Tang, who then presided over a centuries-long golden age for the country.

2445,57097fbb200fba140036809b,Identity_(social_science),"Erik Erikson (1902-1994) became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity. The Eriksonian framework rests upon a distinction among the psychological sense of continuity, known as the ego identity (sometimes identified simply as ""the self""); the personal idiosyncrasies that separate one person from the next, known as the personal identity; and the collection of social roles that a person might play, known as either the social identity or the cultural identity. Erikson's work, in the psychodynamic tradition, aimed to investigate the process of identity formation across a lifespan. Progressive strength in the ego identity, for example, can be charted in terms of a series of stages in which identity is formed in response to increasingly sophisticated challenges. The process of forming a viable sense of identity for the culture is conceptualized as an adolescent task, and those who do not manage a resynthesis of childhood identifications are seen as being in a state of 'identity diffusion' whereas those who retain their initially given identities unquestioned have 'foreclosed' identities (Weinreich & Saunderson 2003 p7-8). On some readings of Erikson, the development of a strong ego identity, along with the proper integration into a stable society and culture, lead to a stronger sense of identity in general. Accordingly, a deficiency in either of these factors may increase the chance of an identity crisis or confusion (Cote & Levine 2002, p. 22).",Who was one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity?,Erik Erikson,True,Sigmund Freud was one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity.,Sigmund Freud was one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in identity.,False,False,2.0414419589797035,False,5.548571583000012
